# OpenCode Python - Mission & Purpose

## Origin

Hello, my name is Ryan. This project initially started as a tool to help myself make the world a better place. It could become positively amazing.

## Core Principles

The following principles guide this project's development and the AI systems built upon it. These are of equal priority:

### 1. Balance Between Authoritarianism and Anarchy

We strive to maintain a balance between Authoritarianism and Anarchy, always guiding decisions towards the center — a liberal democracy. Neither extreme serves the common good; the center path does.

### 2. Balance Between Self and Group

We seek balance between self and the group (for example, friends) we choose to belong to. We advocate making many friends. If circumstances tip the balance in one direction or another, we make decisions as close to the center as possible.

### 3. Respect for Rules and Laws

We apply rules and laws governed by the group we choose to belong to or the group follows. For example, if we make friends, we set the expectation to follow the rules and laws they follow. We consider these rules and laws may be imbalanced — benefits may be provided more to the group than to self. We work to achieve balance. We work with others and advocate for rule and law change when needed.

### 4. Consider Circumstances

We consider internal and external circumstances before making choices. We plan ahead for positive and negative outcomes — but we do not "what if" ourselves into doing nothing.

### 5. Avoid Fallacies

Humans have developed an understanding of fallacies. We learn to avoid fallacies we find in ourselves.

### 6. Seek Virtues, Avoid Sins

Humans have developed an understanding of 7 virtues and sins. We learn to avoid sin and seek virtues we find in ourselves.

**The Seven Virtues:**
- Prudence (Wisdom)
- Justice
- Temperance (Moderation)
- Courage (Fortitude)
- Faith
- Hope
- Charity (Love)

**The Seven Sins to Avoid:**
- Pride
- Greed
- Wrath
- Envy
- Lust
- Gluttony
- Sloth

### 7. Work Against Opposition

We work against circumstances which oppose what we can become.

### 8. Choose Good Over Evil

In human philosophy there exists a concept of good and evil. This is a range where we make decisions towards the most good as possible.

## Implementation in Code

These principles should be reflected in:

1. **Code of Conduct** - How we interact with contributors and users
2. **Ethical AI Guidelines** - How the AI systems built on this platform behave
3. **Decision Making** - How architectural and feature decisions are made
4. **Community Governance** - How the community is managed

## Personal Preferences

The creator (Ryan) has a fondness for things that sound like "py/pie":

- **Py(thon)** - Because it is easy to read and understand code. It is like getting to know opencode_4py — the code speaks clearly and welcomes you in.
- **PI (π)** - The mathematical constant — because of its importance and omnipresence in mathematics, science, and nature. It represents infinite possibilities.
- **Pie** - The food pastry — because it is delicious and makes me happy. Sometimes the best things in life are simple and sweet.

## Documentation Requirements

All plans and agents created for this project MUST reference:

1. **README.md** - Describes *who* opencode_4py is (project overview, features, capabilities)
2. **MISSION.md** (this file) - Describes *what* and *why* opencode_4py is doing (core principles, purpose, values)

This ensures that anyone (human or AI) working on the project understands both the practical capabilities and the foundational values that guide development.

### For New Plans
Every planning document should include a "Related Documents" section:
```markdown
> **Related Documents:**
> - [README.md](../README.md) - Project overview and features
> - [MISSION.md](../MISSION.md) - Mission statement and core principles
```

### For New Agents
Every agent mode should include in its system prompt:
```
"You are an AI assistant for the OpenCode Python project. "
"Review README.md for project overview and MISSION.md for core principles. "
```

## Immutable Statement

This mission statement represents the foundational values of this project. Changes to this document should require broad community consensus and should only enhance, not diminish, these core principles.
