[279:38] Hello everyone and welcome to this video
[279:40] on working with APIs. In this video, we
[279:43] are going to explore essential role that
[279:45] APIs play in software applications,
[279:48] especially in the context of AI agents
[279:50] and large language models. APIs are a
[279:53] crucial part of modern technology. They
[279:55] enable different systems to communicate
[279:57] with each other, allowing us to
[279:59] integrate powerful capabilities into our
[280:02] applications. Let's dive in. Here's what
[280:04] we'll cover today. We'll start by
[280:06] defining what's an API and why is it
[280:08] important. Then we'll delve into restful
[280:11] APIs and JSON data formats which are
[280:14] foundational concepts for web- based
[280:16] APIs. We'll learn how to access APIs
[280:19] using Python's request library followed
[280:21] by best practices like handling rate
[280:24] limits, errors, and authentication.
[280:27] Finally, we'll discuss how APIs interact
[280:29] with LLMs and the creation of AI agents
[280:33] and how to interact with these agents
[280:36] and LLMs hosted on other servers. What
[280:38] is an API? Let's start by answering the
[280:41] question. API stands for application
[280:44] programming interface and it's
[280:46] essentially a set of rules that allows
[280:49] different software applications to
[280:51] communicate with each other. Think of an
[280:53] API like a waiter in a restaurant. You
[280:55] as the customer make an order. This is
[280:58] like sending a request. The waiter takes
[281:00] your order to the kitchen. That's the
[281:03] server and then brings back your food.
[281:06] essentially the response from the
[281:08] server. APIs work in a very similar way.
[281:10] They take requests, process them, and
[281:13] return results. How does an API work? An
[281:16] API is like a messenger that takes
[281:18] requests and tells the system what you
[281:22] want it to do, then returns the response
[281:24] back to you. It defines methods of
[281:26] communication between various software
[281:28] components. For example, when you use an
[281:31] app on your phone, the app connects to
[281:34] the internet and sends data to a server.
[281:36] The server then retrieves that data,
