[17:24] types like lists and tupils. Each of
[17:27] these represent a different type of
[17:29] information that Python can handle. Now,
[17:31] let's understand how to declare and
[17:34] assign values to variables. In Python,
[17:37] you can declare a variable simply by
[17:39] assigning a value to it with a equal to
[17:43] operator. Let's say we want to store the
[17:46] number 50 in a variable named a. We just
[17:49] write a equal to 50. That's it. No need
[17:53] for any extra keywords or statements.
[17:55] Python is very intuitive in this way. If
[17:58] you want to store a in another variable,
[18:01] we can do something like B equal to A.
[18:04] This assigns the value of A to B, making
[18:07] both variables contain 50. Simple and
[18:10] effective. Python has a few core data
[18:14] types that you will be using often.
[18:17] These include integer for whole numbers,
[18:20] float for numbers with decimals, string
[18:23] for text, boolean which represents true
[18:27] or false, and none which represents a
[18:30] variable that has no value. We also have
[18:32] some collections like list, tpples,
[18:35] dictionaries, and sets which are often
[18:38] very helpful for grouping related data.
[18:41] Here you can see strings as well because
[18:44] strings are considered to be collection
[18:46] of characters in Python. Understanding
[18:49] these data types will give you a
[18:50] powerful toolbox for tackling almost any
[18:52] coding problem. There are a few simple
[18:55] rules when it comes to naming variables
[18:58] in Python. First, variable names are
[19:01] case sensitive. So small ABC and capital
[19:06] ABC are considered different variables.
[19:09] Also, variable names must start with a
[19:11] letter or a underscore and never with a
[19:14] number. You can also use numbers in the
[19:16] name, but they can't be at the
[19:18] beginning. And avoid using Python's
[19:21] reserved keywords like if, else, for,
[19:24] while, def, return. These have special
[19:28] meanings in the Python language. As an
[19:30] example, a good variable name might be
[19:32] student score. While something like 123
[19:36] score is not allowed. Keeping these
[19:38] rules in mind will help avoid any errors
[19:42] as you code. Now it's your turn. Let's
[19:46] practice what we have learned by
