[305:34] use. It leverages Python's type hints to
[305:37] provide automatic data validation,
[305:39] serialization, and interactive
[305:41] documentation with asynchronous support
[305:45] built-in. Fast API enables the
[305:47] development of high performance
[305:49] applications. Its focus on developer
[305:51] experience makes it a popular choice for
[305:54] creating robust and scalable APIs
[305:56] quickly. So, comparison between flask
[305:59] and fast API. Both Flask and Fast API
[306:02] are powerful frameworks, but they have
[306:04] different strengths. Flask is simple and
[306:06] straightforward, making it a good choice
[306:08] for beginners and small projects.
[306:10] However, it may require additional
[306:12] plugins or manual coding for features
[306:14] like data validation and documentation.
[306:16] On the other hand, fast API provides a
[306:19] high performance and modern features
[306:20] like asynchronous request handling and
[306:22] automatic documentation generation. It
[306:26] uses Python type hints extensively which
[306:28] can enforce data validation and improve
[306:31] code quality. Finally, while fast API is
[306:34] slightly steeper in terms of learning
[306:37] curve due to its reliance on type hints,
[306:39] it can significantly speed up
[306:41] development of APIs that require robust
[306:44] features and scalability. That's all in
[306:47] this video. See you in the next video
[306:48] where we'll deep dive into the hands-on
[306:50] of API creation and accessing these APIs
[306:53] using Flask framework. So welcome back
[306:56] to this another coding tutorial on
[306:58] flask. We'll be creating and accessing
[307:00] endpoints in this tutorial video. So let
[307:03] us first start by creating a simple
[307:05] flask app. So in this case I'm creating
[307:08] a simple app which will greet the user
[307:11] hello world. Let's see the structure of
[307:13] the flask app. First I'm importing the
[307:16] flask class from the flask library. So
[307:20] by default if you are using Anaconda or
[307:22] even Google Collab Flask would come
[307:25] pre-installed but in case flask is not
[307:28] installed in your machine you should go
[307:31] ahead and do pip install flask before
[307:35] running these codes. Okay. So since I
[307:38] already have flask we'll go ahead. So
