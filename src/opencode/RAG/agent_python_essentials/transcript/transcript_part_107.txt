[230:57] again zero. If you change the axis to
[231:00] one then they will be concatenated side
[231:03] by side. Okay, remember that. So if you
[231:05] want this kind of concatenation you have
[231:08] to make sure that the axis is set to
[231:10] one. So x equal to0 will give vertical
[231:14] concatenation. Axis equal to 1 will give
[231:16] it column wise that is horizontal
[231:19] concatenation.
[231:20] So you can see by default axis is set to
[231:23] zero and that is why it was concatenated
[231:26] vertically. You can also do group by U
[231:29] and pivot tables. So let's do a group by
[231:32] quickly. So I'm grouping all the data
[231:35] frame columns or values by their subject
[231:39] in this case. Let's say so subject wise
[231:42] I want to have the mean of the updated
[231:44] marks. That's what this code says. So
[231:47] can you give me subject wise updated
[231:49] marks mean? So you can also do a sum
[231:53] function here. So fetch the mean marks.
[231:58] Okay. So this is correct. So similarly
[232:00] you can go for the describe function
[232:03] where not only the mean value but also
[232:06] the other statistics are visible here.
[232:09] You can see. So this 96 8578 is already
[232:13] there in the main column. But alongside
[232:15] you have the min and max values also. So
[232:18] subject wise minimum and maximum values
[232:21] 96 96 that's a single value. That's why
[232:23] the standard deviation is not a number.
[232:25] So generative AI is present only once in
[232:27] the entire data frame which is why the
[232:29] standard deviation cannot be computed.
[232:31] So for Python the standard deviation is
[232:33] 7.2 for statistics 7.14. The minimum
[232:36] marks obtained for Python is 79, maximum
[232:39] is 93 and for statistics it is 69 and
[232:42] 86. Seems as statistics uh paper was a
[232:46] bit difficult. Okay. So similarly you
[232:49] can create pivot tables. This is also
[232:51] similar to contingency tables. Okay. So
[232:53] here again you can set which column is
[232:57] to be set as index and which column will
[233:00] be set as the value. So here I have the
[233:05] aggregation function. Now your
[233:06] aggregation function can be uh mean, it
[233:10] can be minimum, it can be max function,
[233:13] it can be sum function or any of these.
[233:16] So or median. So several aggregation
