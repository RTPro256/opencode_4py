[252:20] model. OM allows you to interact with
[252:23] your databases using Python classes and
[252:25] objects instead of raw SQL code. This
[252:28] offers a layer of abstraction that makes
[252:30] development faster and code easier to
[252:33] maintain. With an OM, you can create and
[252:36] modify tables by simply defining classes
[252:39] in Python. This not only improves
[252:42] productivity, but also makes it easier
[252:44] to switch between databases if needed
[252:48] since the same Python code can be used
[252:50] with different database backends. SQL
[252:53] Alchemy is well established in the
[252:55] Python ecosystem, providing robust
[252:57] features and support for various
[253:00] databases. SQL model builds on top of
[253:02] SQL alchemy and piantic simplifying
[253:06] model creation with modern Python syntax
[253:09] and type annotations. It streamlines the
[253:12] process of defining database models and
[253:14] integrates well with fast API making it
[253:17] ideal for building APIs and AI
[253:20] applications that require data
[253:22] persistence and validation. Let's
[253:24] summarize what we have learned today.
[253:26] Connecting Python to SQL databases allow
[253:29] for efficient and scalable data
[253:31] handling. We explored libraries like
[253:33] MySQL connector Python and Psychopg2 for
[253:36] database connectivity. Pandas integrate
[253:38] seamlessly with SQL databases for data
[253:40] manipulation making it a powerful tool
[253:43] for data analysis. OM frameworks like
[253:46] SQL alchemy and SQL model provide
[253:49] advantages over raw SQL queries
[253:53] including abstraction productivity and
[253:55] easier maintenance. These concepts are
[253:57] fundamental for building datadriven
[253:59] applications and mastering them will
[254:02] make your workflows much more efficient.
[254:07] Hello and welcome back. In this video
[254:10] we'll explore working with files and
[254:12] databases in Python. Understanding how
[254:15] to handle files and databases is crucial
[254:18] when building real world datadriven
[254:20] applications. We'll dive into CSV and
[254:22] JSON file formats, how to interact with
[254:25] them using Python, and how to integrate
[254:28] them with databases. Let's get started.
[254:30] Here's what we'll cover in this video.
