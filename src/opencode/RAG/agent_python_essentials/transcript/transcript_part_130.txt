[281:38] interprets it, performs the necessary
[281:41] actions, and sends it back to your
[281:43] phone. The app then interprets that
[281:44] data, and presents you with the
[281:47] information that you wanted in a
[281:48] readable way. Why are APIs important?
[281:51] APIs are important for several reasons.
[281:53] Interoperability.
[281:55] They enable different systems to work
[281:57] together, allowing data and services to
[281:59] be shared seamlessly. Scalability. APIs
[282:03] can support multiple clients, allowing
[282:05] different platforms to access the same
[282:08] core services. Reusability. Instead of
[282:11] building new functionalities from
[282:12] scratch, you can use existing services
[282:16] through APIs. Innovation. APIs encourage
[282:19] the development of new applications by
[282:21] giving developers access to powerful
[282:24] functionalities and accessibility. They
[282:27] make data and services available even
[282:29] those hosted externally which would
[282:32] otherwise be challenging to access. For
[282:35] example, using Google Maps API,
[282:38] developers can easily integrate mapping
[282:41] and geoloccation features without
[282:43] building their own mapping systems from
[282:46] scratch. Real world examples of APIs.
[282:49] APIs are everywhere. When you log into a
[282:51] website using your Facebook or Google
[282:54] account, there's an API at work. When an
[282:56] app shows you a map or your current
[282:58] location, it's using an API for a
[283:01] mapping service. Payment gateways use
[283:04] APIs to process transactions securely.
[283:07] Even chatbots and virtual assistants use
[283:09] APIs to understand and respond to your
[283:13] user input. These are just few examples
[283:16] of how APIs make our digital
[283:18] interactions seamless and efficient.
[283:21] APIs in the context of LLM and AI
[283:24] agents. APIs play a significant role in
[283:27] AI. APIs allow developers to access
[283:30] pre-trained models and services like
[283:33] OpenAI's GPT models, hugging face
[283:36] models, and Google Cloud AI services
[283:39] without having to build these models
[283:41] from scratch. Using these APIs, you can
[283:44] offload the computational complexity to
[283:47] external servers, allowing you to
