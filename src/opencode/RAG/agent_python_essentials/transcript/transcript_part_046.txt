[98:54] two lines because anyway it's quite
[98:56] self-explanatory, right? It is pretty
[98:59] obvious code. So ideally comments have
[99:02] to be added in your code when you are
[99:05] trying to explain why something is being
[99:08] done. Another example uh you have
[99:10] written a function here and a good code
[99:13] would give a quick idea about what that
[99:16] function is doing. So this is called as
[99:18] dock string. You can see three double
[99:21] quotes start and three double quotes
[99:23] end. So anything in this anything
[99:26] between this block that is called as
[99:27] dock string. Okay documentation string
[99:30] in short as dock string. So ideally in
[99:34] the dock string you should be able to
[99:36] provide what that function does and what
[99:38] kind of input it takes and what
[99:40] computation it does and what kind of
[99:42] output it returns. So everything should
[99:44] be documented in the doxing standard. So
[99:46] we'll see more details about the docking
[99:48] in the example in the later part of this
[99:51] notebook. So currently I've got a
[99:53] function which at least gives us an idea
[99:56] about what that function does. Okay. So
[99:58] let me run this code and show you the
[100:01] advantage of having this documentation
[100:03] string. So I am just using calculate
[100:06] area and uh if you see now I'm pressing
[100:10] in the keyboard shift tab okay or shift
[100:13] tab tab shift tab will give you a quick
[100:16] dock string about that function. So
[100:18] without this without this dock string no
[100:21] it's very difficult to figure out what
[100:23] that function is doing. Okay. So let me
[100:25] just remove this and uh show you that
[100:29] function again. So now again I'm doing
[100:32] shift tab tab. If you see dock string no
[100:35] dock string is provided and that is
[100:37] exactly what I was trying to convey. So
[100:40] it's a good idea to provide the dock
[100:42] strings so that we get to know what that
[100:44] function does. Now let's take some more
[100:46] examples of pythonic guides uh for AI
[100:50] codes. So in the first example we see
[100:53] that we should be using list
[100:55] comprehensions more frequently instead
[100:58] of using nave simple loops for data
[101:01] transformations. So let me give an
