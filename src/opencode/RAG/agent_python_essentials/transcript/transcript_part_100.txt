[215:28] have to make sure that the axis is set
[215:30] to one. So x is equal to0 will give
[215:34] vertical concatenation. xis equal to 1
[215:37] will give it column wise that is
[215:39] horizontal concatenation.
[215:41] So you can see by default access is set
[215:43] to zero and that is why it was
[215:46] concatenated vertically. You can also do
[215:48] group by u and pivot tables. So let's do
[215:52] a group by quickly. So I'm grouping all
[215:55] the data frame columns or values by
[215:59] their subject in this case. Let's say so
[216:02] subject-wise I want to have the mean of
[216:04] the updated marks. That's what this code
[216:07] says. So can you give me subject-wise
[216:10] updated marks mean? So you can also do a
[216:14] sum function here. So fetch the mean
[216:18] marks. Okay. So this is correct. So
[216:21] similarly you can go for the describe
[216:23] function where not only the mean value
[216:26] but also the other statistics are
[216:29] visible. Here you can see so this 96
[216:32] 8578 is already there in the main column
[216:35] but alongside you have the min and max
[216:38] values also. So subject wise minimum and
[216:41] maximum values 96 96 that's a single
[216:43] value that's why the standard deviation
[216:45] is not a number. So generative AI is
[216:47] present only once in the entire data
[216:49] frame which is why the standard
[216:50] deviation cannot be computed. So for
[216:52] Python the standard deviation is 7.2 for
[216:55] statistics 7.14. The minimum marks
[216:58] obtained for Python is 79, maximum is 93
[217:01] and for statistics it is 69 and 86. Same
[217:04] as statistics uh paper was a bit
[217:07] difficult. Okay. So similarly you can
[217:10] create pivot tables. This is also
[217:12] similar to contingency tables. Okay. So
[217:14] here again you can set which column is
[217:18] to be set as index and which column will
[217:21] be set as the values. So here I have the
[217:26] aggregation function. Now your
[217:28] aggregation function can be uh mean, it
[217:31] can be minimum, it can be max function,
[217:34] it can be sum function or any of these.
[217:37] So or median. So several aggregation
[217:40] functions you can apply on this values.
[217:44] So the aggregation function is always
[217:45] applied on the values and you can
