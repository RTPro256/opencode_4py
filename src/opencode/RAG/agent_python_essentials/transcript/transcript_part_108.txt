[233:19] functions you can apply on this values.
[233:22] So the aggregation function is always
[233:24] applied on the values and you can
[233:27] provide index. So here goes the index.
[233:30] So here goes the index and the
[233:32] aggregation functions are applied on the
[233:34] values here. So you can also apply
[233:36] multiple aggregation functions if you
[233:38] want. Yeah, you can see. So this is the
[233:41] mean marks and the minimum marks. So
[233:43] multiple aggregation functions can be
[233:45] easily applied. So what is the
[233:47] difference between pivot tables and
[233:49] group by then? So group by typically
[233:50] works for single dimensional summaries
[233:53] whereas pivot table is more flexible and
[233:55] ideal for multi-dimensional summaries.
[233:57] Let's take an example. So here I'm
[234:00] creating a single dimensional summary
[234:02] for each gender. I want to get the
[234:05] average updated marks. So the females uh
[234:09] updated marks average value is 82.33 and
[234:14] for males the average is 83.6. Now not
[234:18] only the average of the marks but let's
[234:20] say I want to get the average marks of
[234:24] each gender across the three subjects.
[234:27] So that is where the pivot table would
[234:29] be a better choice. So if you see so for
[234:32] each gender
[234:34] and each subject so these are the three
[234:37] subjects. So subject one subject two
[234:40] subject for each subject I've got my
[234:43] mean aggregation function here is the
[234:45] mean. So this is the average marks for
[234:47] each of the three subjects and these
[234:49] subjects are uh being put in the
[234:53] columns. Can you see the columns
[234:56] are in the subject and index
[235:00] is present here in the rows. Okay. So
[235:02] index always refers to the rows columns
[235:05] anyway in the columns and the values for
[235:08] which the aggregation function is going
[235:10] to be applied.
[235:12] Okay. So this aggregation function is
[235:14] going to be always applied on the
[235:16] values. So that is how you can create
[235:18] more complex summaries by using pivot
[235:21] tables. Finally, let's have a look into
[235:24] how can we use apply and map functions.
[235:27] So, I'm uh so we have already seen the
