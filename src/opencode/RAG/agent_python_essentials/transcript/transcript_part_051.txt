[109:41] here uh the class names which is again a
[109:44] machine learning model that is my class
[109:46] name that should again be in the camel
[109:48] case instead of the snake case which is
[109:50] the naming mistake again we are doing
[109:53] here and uh if you see the function
[109:55] definition that is in the camel case
[109:57] rather that should have been the snake
[109:59] case so you cannot interchange them
[110:02] another very common mistake people do is
[110:04] trying to overly use the equality
[110:07] operator okay This is to check uh
[110:09] equality of something whether a variable
[110:12] is equal to something or not. So let's
[110:14] say your variable value is uh 10 and if
[110:18] you want to check whether that variable
[110:22] is none or not. Okay. So instead of
[110:24] using this it's better to use if
[110:26] variable is none. Okay. Instead of
[110:29] checking that the variable's value is
[110:31] none. Check whether the variable itself
[110:34] is none or not. So this is a better way
[110:36] of handling. If you want to check
[110:37] whether it is being compared to none or
[110:40] not. If it is being compared to some
[110:42] other number then it is fine. Uh if you
[110:44] want to check it with respect to let's
[110:46] say 100 then this code is perfectly
[110:49] fine. But if you are checking with
[110:51] respect to none then the better way is
[110:53] to go with this. Finally we should avoid
[110:57] inputting any unused modules. So for
[110:59] example in this code I want to find out
[111:02] the square root of a given number and
[111:05] I'm defining a function for that. So
[111:07] here you can see uh I have imported the
[111:10] math module, the OS module and the
[111:13] random module and I'm not using any of
[111:16] them. So this is not a good way of
[111:19] writing codes simply importing the
[111:21] modules which keep occupying the memory.
[111:23] So a better way is if you can reproduce
[111:26] the functionality by your own code or by
[111:30] some custom functions that is the best.
[111:32] So in this case only this function
[111:34] remains in the memory instead of all
[111:36] those redundant modules which we are not
[111:39] using anyway. So in this case if you
[111:42] want you can also import the math module
[111:44] and actually the math module is being
