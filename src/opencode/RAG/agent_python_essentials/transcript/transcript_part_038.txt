[82:01] so now let's have a look into the
[82:02] keyword arguments. So if you are
[82:05] defining the keywords then we can define
[82:08] the input arguments in any order. So now
[82:10] you are saying larger number take it to
[82:13] be 16 smaller number take it to be four.
[82:15] So here I'm providing the larger number
[82:17] before the smaller number. You can also
[82:19] provide the smaller number before the
[82:20] larger number. As long as you are
[82:22] assigning the values based on the exact
[82:25] name of the input arguments. Now this
[82:27] cannot be any variable name. This has to
[82:30] be the same variable name which the
[82:32] function expects. Okay. So if you're
[82:35] defining it as a and b here also you
[82:38] have to provide it as a and b. Okay. So
[82:41] you have to remember that. So advantage
[82:43] of doing this is you can see since
[82:45] larger number is mapped to 16 whether at
[82:48] the start or at the end doesn't matter
[82:50] the difference between the larger number
[82:52] and the smaller number is still 12.
[82:54] Okay. So this time a consistent output
[82:56] is returned even though the sequence in
[82:59] which the arguments were passed is
[83:02] different. Okay. Now the problem starts
[83:05] when you try to mix and match. Here you
[83:07] have a keyword argument and here is a
[83:09] positional argument. This will throw you
[83:12] an error saying that the positional
[83:14] argument follows a keyword argument. So
[83:16] if you are passing an input, if you're
[83:19] providing an input to the function while
[83:22] calling without mapping it to the exact
[83:26] input parameter name, that becomes a
[83:28] positional argument. All the positional
[83:30] arguments have to be defined before any
[83:34] of the keyword arguments. So here since
[83:37] you are passing the value of four by
[83:39] defining the variable name to which it
[83:41] has to be mapped, this becomes a keyword
[83:43] argument. And here 16 is not being
[83:47] specified which variable to be mapped
[83:50] to. So this is actually a positional
[83:52] argument. Simple. So that has to be done
[83:55] in the other way around. Okay. So here
[83:58] four is the positional argument and 16
[84:00] is a keyword argument. And then that's
[84:02] exactly what this statement says. All
