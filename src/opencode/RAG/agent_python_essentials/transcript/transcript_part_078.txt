[166:46] written in the x-axis label, y-axis
[166:48] label and the title. Okay. You can also
[166:50] create a stacked bar charts as well.
[166:53] Okay. So if you have multiple
[166:54] categories, you want to create a you
[166:56] know bariate two categorical data
[166:58] simultaneously, you can go for stacked
[167:00] bar charts as well. Okay. Again
[167:02] histogram is for univariate data. Okay.
[167:05] Especially if the data is numerical.
[167:07] Okay, you want to provide or you want to
[167:10] visualize the distribution of the data
[167:12] across multiple bins of the values.
[167:15] Okay, so you can provide how many bins
[167:17] you want in the x-axis. The default
[167:19] number of bins would be 10 I think and
[167:22] then what should be the data used for
[167:24] plotting the histogram and then what
[167:26] should be the color of the bars in the
[167:29] histogram and then the transparency
[167:31] level and what should be the edge color.
[167:33] So even in the previous plots you have
[167:35] an option to provide the edge color and
[167:37] so on. Okay. So I'm again creating
[167:40] normal distribution of random 1,00
[167:42] numbers with normal distribution. Rand n
[167:45] this is a rand n function. N represents
[167:49] a normal distribution. Okay. So randomly
[167:51] distributed numbers coming from normal
[167:54] distribution. Okay. So you can see the
[167:56] purpose. The main difference between the
[167:58] bar chart and the histogram is the bar
[168:00] charts are discrete. There will always
[168:03] be some spacing because these are
[168:04] discrete values. Okay. A B C already.
[168:08] Okay. This is categorical data. That's
[168:10] why you will always have space in a bar
[168:12] chart. This is for a continuous data. So
[168:14] you will never have a space. Okay. And
[168:16] this is for a continuous data. You
[168:18] cannot mix and match. Okay? So you
[168:20] cannot use a bar chart for you cannot
[168:23] use a bar chart for continuous data or
[168:25] you cannot use the histogram for
[168:28] categorical data. That will not make
[168:29] sense. Now let's have a look at the box
[168:32] plots. We want to first create three
[168:35] numpy arrays. Here I'm going to use the
[168:37] normal function to create these numpy
[168:40] arrays normally distributed values. So
