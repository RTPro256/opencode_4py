[75:09] lines of code that needs to be executed
[75:12] multiple times. So we'll be using the
[75:14] defaf keyword to create the function
[75:16] definition that should be followed by
[75:19] the function name. So here def is used
[75:23] to create the function. The name of the
[75:25] function here is welcome. So what does
[75:27] this function do? This will print
[75:30] welcome to the Python course. So let me
[75:32] create the function here. Now calling
[75:35] the function is simple. You just have to
[75:38] take the name of the function followed
[75:40] by the parenthesis. So let me call the
[75:44] function here. So it prints welcome to
[75:46] the Python course. Again I'm calling the
[75:49] function. It again prints. So as many
[75:51] times I keep calling the function. Okay,
[75:53] this will execute all the lines of code
[75:56] within the function definition and so
[75:59] on. Now I'm creating another function
[76:02] here which is going to add two numbers.
[76:05] Okay, these two numbers are already set
[76:08] as 3 and 4 and the total is 3 + 4 7 and
[76:13] it will print the total. So let me
[76:17] create the function and create another
[76:20] function. We'll see what is the
[76:22] difference between these two. So let me
[76:25] execute the function. You can see the
[76:27] print statement got executed from here
[76:30] and the total is printed as seven. Okay,
[76:33] you can change these numbers and see uh
[76:36] this is 30 + 4 now. So this will become
[76:39] 34. Okay, now I'm assigning the output
[76:44] of this function to a variable here.
[76:46] Okay, let me print the value of the
[76:49] output. It doesn't print anything. Okay,
[76:51] let me see the data type of this output.
[76:57] It says none. So essenti it seems that
[77:00] nothing was stored in the output one
[77:02] that's why the output data type is none.
[77:06] So nothing was stored here. It's a null
[77:08] pointer. Essentially this is a null
[77:10] pointer. Nothing was stored here. So I'm
[77:12] slightly modifying the main function to
[77:15] return the value of the total. So this
[77:18] is the additional code. So till here it
[77:21] was the same. This is the additional
[77:23] code which returns the value of the
[77:25] total. So when I save the output of the
[77:30] function with that return into another
