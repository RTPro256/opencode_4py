[68:57] the number is again set to zero and this
[68:59] number will have value from 0 to 9.
[69:02] Okay, if the number is five, don't do
[69:04] anything. Pass says don't do anything.
[69:06] If you let's say comment this statement,
[69:09] it will throw an error because under the
[69:11] if condition, nothing, no valid Python
[69:14] statement was executed. Okay. Now this
[69:17] print is a part of the for loop. it is
[69:20] not a part of the if condition because
[69:22] it is indented in the same level. Now
[69:26] this pass which is indented within the
[69:28] if is actually a part of the if
[69:30] condition. Okay, so that is exactly the
[69:33] use case here. Okay, indentation error.
[69:36] So if I do not have a valid Python
[69:39] statement, it could be anything like a
[69:41] simple print statement, this will work.
[69:44] Okay, let me Yeah, this will work. But
[69:48] let's say if I do not give any valid
[69:51] Python statement, this will again give
[69:53] me an error. Okay. So let's say I do not
[69:57] want to execute anything if this
[70:00] condition is met. Maybe I want to write
[70:02] down the code tomorrow or maybe after
[70:04] some discussion with my colleagues.
[70:06] Okay. What exactly has to be done when
[70:07] the number is equal to five? Right now I
[70:09] do not have the answer to it. Let's say
[70:13] in a simple example scenario. So you
[70:15] have created a placeholder. Okay, that
[70:18] if the number is five, do something. But
[70:20] what exactly? You don't know, you don't
[70:22] want to specify, you do not want to
[70:24] write down the code immediately. So just
[70:27] pass. Okay, so this becomes a valid
[70:29] Python statement and the iterations
[70:31] continue. That is exactly the purpose of
[70:33] pass. You can use the pass statement
[70:35] along with um loops, any of the loops,
[70:38] if conditions. You can use it in the try
[70:42] except blocks, function definitions,
[70:44] class definitions. Everywhere you want
[70:46] to create an empty Python construct
[70:49] without specifying lines of code, you
[70:51] can use pass.
[70:53] Functions are one of the most powerful
[70:55] tools you can use in your code, allowing
[70:59] you to reuse blocks of code, making your
[71:02] programs more organized and much easier
