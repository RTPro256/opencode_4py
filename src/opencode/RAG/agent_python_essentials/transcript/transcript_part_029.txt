[62:18] the loop before continuing and ignore.
[62:22] So let's see the break statement first.
[62:25] So break statement provides an
[62:27] opportunity to exit out of the loop when
[62:29] some condition is met. Okay, let's see.
[62:32] So in this case I've got the number
[62:34] again set to zero initially. I'm going
[62:37] to increment this number one by one
[62:39] until 9. The range starts from zero goes
[62:42] until 9. So range value will
[62:44] automatically increment because of the
[62:45] range generator function. The moment
[62:49] this number is equal to five, I want to
[62:51] break out of the loop here. So the for
[62:54] loop is being forcefully broken. Okay.
[62:58] So let me execute this. You can see the
[63:00] number is 0 1 2 3 4. In the next
[63:03] iteration, okay, the number is five. The
[63:06] moment it is five, okay, this condition
[63:10] becomes true. So, it breaks out of the
[63:12] loop. Okay, and the moment it breaks out
[63:15] of the loop, this is not executed. So,
[63:18] anything please remember this. Any
[63:20] Python statement which comes below the
[63:23] break will never get executed. Okay,
[63:26] below the break and part of the loop.
[63:28] Okay, now this print is not a part of
[63:30] the for loop. So this gets executed. So
[63:34] any statement below the break and part
[63:36] of the main loop will not get executed.
[63:39] This print is out of the for loop. So
[63:41] gets executed. Let's take another
[63:43] example.
[63:44] So here the user will be asked to enter
[63:47] a password which is already set to be
[63:48] data and if the password matches it will
[63:52] print welcome to the Python course
[63:53] otherwise it will print wrong password.
[63:56] Okay. So the user will get four trials.
[64:00] Okay. So uh the trial number 1 2 3 and
[64:04] four. Okay. The moment the trial four is
[64:08] reached it will warn you that this is
[64:10] your last trial. Okay. And uh as usual
[64:13] it will keep on asking for entering the
[64:15] password and if the password matches in
[64:18] any of the iterations okay it will
[64:21] simply print welcome to the course and
[64:23] break out of the loop. So now this break
[64:25] can get executed in the very first
[64:27] iteration also if the password matches.
