[51:17] provide a valid answer. Next, we have
[51:19] the for loop. This is used when we know
[51:22] exactly how many times we want to repeat
[51:25] something. It's great for iterating over
[51:27] sequences like a list of numbers or a
[51:29] set of items. It's predictable, making
[51:32] it perfect for situations where we know
[51:34] how many iterations are needed. Let's
[51:37] talk a bit more about the while loop.
[51:39] For instance, we want to keep asking a
[51:41] user for their age until they provide a
[51:43] valid number. A while loop is the way to
[51:46] go. It repeats until the condition
[51:48] becomes false, then it stops. It's
[51:51] perfect when you need to repeat a task
[51:53] an unknown number of times. The while
[51:55] loop is like saying keep repeating this
[51:58] block of code while the condition is
[52:00] true. Now let's move on for the for
[52:03] loop. The for loop is used for iterating
[52:05] over sequences whether it's a list,
[52:08] string, or even range of numbers. It's
[52:10] great when we know exactly how many
[52:13] times we need to repeat something. Think
[52:15] of the for loop as going through a to-do
[52:17] list one by one. You tackle each item
[52:21] until you have completed them all.
[52:22] Whether you are looping through the
[52:24] numbers from 1 to 10 or printing each
[52:26] item in a list, the for loop is the
[52:28] perfect tool. We also have nested loops
[52:31] which are loops inside other loops.
[52:33] These are often used when we need to
[52:35] work with multi-dimensional data.
[52:38] Imagine you have a grid of values like
[52:40] rows and columns in a table. You could
[52:42] use a nested loop to go through each row
[52:45] and within each row visit every column.
[52:48] While powerful, nested loop can be a bit
[52:50] tricky and it's important to be careful
[52:52] when using them. Too many nested loops
[52:55] can make your code harder to read. So,
[52:57] use them wisely. All right, enough
[52:59] theory. It's time for some hands-on
[53:02] coding. Let's open our Python
[53:04] environment and practice both the while
[53:06] loop and the for loops. Thank you for
[53:08] joining me in this video on looping
[53:10] constructs. I hope you now feel more
[53:12] comfortable with loops and how they can
