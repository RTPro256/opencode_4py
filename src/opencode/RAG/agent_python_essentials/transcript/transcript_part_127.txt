[275:06] not needed on a single usage but if
[275:10] there are multiple users connected to
[275:13] the same database and repeatedly doing
[275:15] lot of SQL operations then this might be
[275:18] needed once everything is done. Okay. So
[275:21] in the last part of this notebook we are
[275:23] going to connect a posgress database
[275:26] using Python. So as discussed in the
[275:29] presentation in the previous video, I'm
[275:32] going to use the psychopg2 package. So
[275:35] first try to install psychopg2
[275:38] using this. So first try to install
[275:40] psychopg2 using this command. So just
[275:43] unccommend this and execute. If there is
[275:46] any error in the installation then try
[275:49] the next one. So depends on the machine
[275:52] and the server. Okay, the
[275:53] configurations. So sometimes the first
[275:56] one would work or else the next line
[275:59] would work but try in that sequence. So
[276:02] I have already installed the psychoppg2
[276:04] library
[276:05] and then as usual you have your database
[276:08] configurations. So this is the posgress
[276:10] SQL database which is again hosted on my
[276:13] RDS instance on AWS. So this is the
[276:15] endpoint. Uh Postgress database
[276:17] connections uh typically use port 5432
[276:21] by default. This is the name of my
[276:23] database. The admin username for my
[276:26] database and the password. So with these
[276:30] let me start connection. So importing
[276:33] the psychopg2 library and then uh also
[276:36] importing the error. It's a good
[276:38] programming practice to use try except
[276:40] blocks again as we did in the previous
[276:42] case. So here I'm creating a function to
[276:45] create a connection. So the advantage of
[276:48] doing this is I can directly call this
[276:50] function which will create the
[276:52] connection directly and it will return
[276:54] that connection. So I can use this
[276:56] connection in my pandas directly. So the
[276:59] other things are pretty uh
[277:01] self-explanatory. We have been doing
[277:03] this and to execute the SQL queries
[277:05] again I'm creating a function. So it
[277:07] will need that connection and the query.
[277:09] After establishing a cursor to that
[277:13] connection, it will execute that query
