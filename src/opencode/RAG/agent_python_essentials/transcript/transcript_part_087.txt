[185:53] So what is pandas? You might be
[185:54] wondering. Pandas is a popular
[185:58] open-source library in Python used for
[186:01] data manipulation and analysis. Pandas
[186:03] provides powerful data structures which
[186:06] we'll see as data frames and series and
[186:09] these are used to store and manipulate
[186:11] large data sets with ease.
[186:16] Using pandas you can load data from
[186:18] various sources like CSV, Excel or even
[186:21] SQL databases.
[186:23] You can also claim your data sets. You
[186:26] can reshape them. You can also analyze
[186:28] this data very quickly using wide range
[186:31] of functions which are built in
[186:33] available in pandas. So let's get
[186:35] started. In case pandas is not
[186:38] installed, you can just unccommend this
[186:40] and uh install pandas. Most likely if
[186:43] you are using Google collab or anaconda
[186:46] environment, pandas would come
[186:48] pre-installed.
[186:50] So I have one uh code here which
[186:53] instructs pandas to ignore any warnings.
[186:57] Warnings are different from errors.
[186:59] Okay. So first we'll see how to import a
[187:03] data file which is present as a CSV. CSV
[187:06] is commaepparated value file. So I have
[187:09] got a churn prediction docsv file. I'm
[187:11] going to import this in pandas. So we'll
[187:13] be using the read csv function to do
[187:16] this. Okay. And once we have read that
[187:19] CSV file, I'm storing it in the form of
[187:22] a data frame and I'm displaying the
[187:25] first five rows of that data frame. So
[187:27] this is how it appears. So data frame.
[187:31] So data frame objects are basically
[187:34] two-dimensional like you have few rows
[187:37] and you have few columns. Okay. So that
[187:40] is two-dimensional.
[187:42] Whereas each column of the data frame is
[187:46] essentially a series in Python. Okay. So
[187:49] this is one series. This is another
[187:51] series. This is another series. In fact,
[187:55] every row of this data frame. So you can
[187:59] take out any of the rows. Let's say this
[188:01] row. This row would also be considered
[188:04] as series. Any row or any single column
[188:07] will be a series. So series is
