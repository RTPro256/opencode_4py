[346:04] here you can see this is the model link.
[346:07] However for now we'll directly use the
[346:10] model API URL. Okay. So let's execute
[346:14] this. Similarly this is the API URL for
[346:16] the GMA 2B it model that we are going to
[346:19] use. So there are some standard
[346:21] parameters. For example, wait for the
[346:23] model's response. Yes. and um we don't
[346:27] want to return the full text. The
[346:29] maximum tokens we want to return is only
[346:31] 1,000 and so on. So let's start uh
[346:34] prompting our models. Uh first we'll
[346:36] take a basic Q&A uh question and
[346:38] answering. This is zero short prompting
[346:40] to the model. So here the prompt that I
[346:44] am passing to the model is can you
[346:45] explain what is quantum computing to a
[346:48] fifth grader. So this is the complete
[346:50] prompt. Uh let me print the prompt and
[346:53] this is the model's API URL. Okay. And
[346:57] uh when you run this code you'll get the
[347:00] response from the model. So here I'm
[347:03] passing the parameters for the Mistl
[347:06] model and the model API URL I'm using is
[347:09] for the Mistl. So basically this
[347:11] response was obtained from Mistl model.
[347:15] Now there might be a possibility that
[347:17] you may get an error. So if you are
[347:20] getting an error, most likely reason is
[347:22] you will have to go ahead and accept the
[347:25] uh license. So click on this link. This
[347:28] will take you to the model card page.
[347:31] And uh you might get a window here to
[347:34] accept. So since I have already
[347:37] accepted, I have been granted access to
[347:40] this model. So this is a gated model. So
[347:42] you will have to accept the license
[347:46] agreement for this model. Yeah. So for
[347:49] example if I click on Gemma 2B it okay
[347:53] so this is the kind of window you will
[347:55] get even for the Mistl model the first
[347:57] time you try to access it. So the moment
[348:00] I acknowledge the license I will be
[348:03] granted access to this model. So let me
[348:06] authorize this model. So this is a
[348:08] one-time activity. So this model will be
[348:10] now accessible to your account. So again
[348:14] the message says you have been granted
[348:16] access to this model. So this is one
[348:18] time activity you might have to do for
