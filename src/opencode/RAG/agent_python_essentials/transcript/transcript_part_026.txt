[55:37] stop once the range value has reached
[55:39] one before
[55:41] the stop point. So it will go from 1 to
[55:45] four this time. Okay? Because the
[55:47] starting number is one ending number is
[55:49] five. So it will end one before that.
[55:52] You can also use steps.
[55:54] So in this case I'm providing my
[55:56] starting number, ending number and this
[55:59] is my step size. So step size is by
[56:02] default one. Here I have increased it to
[56:04] two which says that give me all the
[56:07] numbers from 1 to 9. It will stop one
[56:09] before 10. So it will be 1 to 9. Give me
[56:11] all the numbers from 1 to 9 by skipping
[56:14] every alternate number. So every second
[56:17] number is what you want. Okay. So let's
[56:19] see. So 1 2 3 5 7 and 9. Yeah. So you
[56:24] are printing the number at the end you
[56:27] are printing a space a white space that
[56:30] is the exact reason why it is not coming
[56:33] one below the other it is here the
[56:36] default end is back slashn which is
[56:39] basically a new line feed that is the
[56:41] default end you have changed it to a a
[56:44] white space which is why the subsequent
[56:46] iterations are printed one after the
[56:50] other in the same line now here I want
[56:52] to iterate over a string using a for
[56:55] loop. If you remember in the first video
[56:57] we had seen that string is essentially
[57:00] also a collection. It's a collection of
[57:02] characters. Okay, it's also a
[57:05] collection.
[57:06] So here what I'm saying is for character
[57:09] in analytics with okay I want to fetch
[57:12] each and every character and print them.
[57:16] Perfect. So in the first iteration a was
[57:18] fetched in the next iteration n was
[57:20] fetched and so on. So one by one each
[57:22] character is fetched and it is being
[57:25] printed. Okay. And again if you want to
[57:28] use the end here you can very well go
[57:30] ahead and use end. So I'll just
[57:36] rerun this and you can see
[57:40] okay
[57:44] now for the nested for loops. So nested
[57:46] for loop is nothing but a loop within
[57:50] another loop. Fine. So there will be an
[57:53] outer loop and there will be an inner
