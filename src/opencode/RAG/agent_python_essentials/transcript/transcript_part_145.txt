[314:32] get method. So get method is enabled by
[314:34] default even though even though you did
[314:37] not mention the list of methods here.
[314:39] Okay. In the next one I'm going to
[314:41] explicitly mention which methods are
[314:44] allowed for that endpoint. So here the
[314:47] get method is the only method which is
[314:48] allowed for this square root endpoint.
[314:50] So this square root endpoint is being
[314:53] programmed here to take two numbers as
[314:56] the input. I'm going to divide these two
[314:58] numbers and the resultant number I'm
[315:01] going to fade it to the square root
[315:03] function. So I'm going to calculate the
[315:05] square root of the division result. So
[315:07] two numbers are going to be taken as a
[315:09] input. These two numbers would be
[315:11] divided and the resultant division
[315:14] result will be used for square root.
[315:17] that square root will be result that
[315:19] square root will be returned back to the
[315:21] user that square root will be returned
[315:24] back to the user along with the division
[315:26] result. Okay. So there are two outputs
[315:28] this time. One is the division result
[315:30] and the other is the square root. So if
[315:32] you look into the uh definition more
[315:34] closely I have enclosed the entire code
[315:38] within a try accept block. So these two
[315:41] numbers will be requested from the user
[315:43] num one and num two. And if either of
[315:46] the numbers are not provided then it
[315:48] will throw this error. If the second
[315:51] number is zero then we'll end up with a
[315:54] zero division error. Otherwise if
[315:57] everything is right we'll calculate the
[315:59] division result. And if one of the
[316:01] numbers is negative okay either the
[316:04] numerator or denominator. If one of them
[316:06] is negative then the square root
[316:08] operation cannot be uh done because
[316:10] square root of a negative number is
[316:12] complex. So that is a bit difficult to
[316:15] handle here. So I'm just throwing that
[316:18] error because one of the numbers is
[316:20] negative. And if all the conditions are
[316:22] satisfied, then this operation is
[316:25] conducted. Okay. So let's execute this.
[316:29] Okay. Now my app is running. Oh, I think
[316:32] I forgot to stop my previous app. Okay,
