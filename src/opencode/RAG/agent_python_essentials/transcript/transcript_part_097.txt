[208:47] code to get. So now you want to fill the
[208:50] missing values with the average value of
[208:54] that column. Let's say uh right now the
[208:56] missing value is present in the age
[208:59] column. So you can take the average age
[209:02] and fill the missing values. So fill NA
[209:04] function fill the nan values. That's
[209:07] what this function does. Filling the nan
[209:09] values. Okay, fill na is fill the nan
[209:12] values in that column. So again by
[209:15] default that is false. So you'll have to
[209:17] make it true so that the filling happens
[209:19] permanently or replace the original
[209:22] column either way. So after filling
[209:25] replace the original column that is one
[209:26] way or you use the in place option. So
[209:30] now you can see this 23.5 and this 23.5
[209:33] is coming because of the fill na
[209:36] function. Earlier these were nans. So
[209:38] you can check the info and if you want
[209:40] you can convert it back into a integer
[209:42] format. So you will lose some precision.
[209:44] So these decimal points will be ignored
[209:46] then. Okay. Or rounded to the nearest
[209:49] whole number. So I have type casted it
[209:51] back to a integer. So it depends on your
[209:54] use case. You might want to do that. So
[209:56] here the function used is as type. As
[209:59] type changes the data type of a column
[210:01] to a specified data type. So I am type
[210:04] casting it back to a integer. So you can
[210:06] type cast it to a integer 8 bit, 16 bit
[210:10] or a 32-bit precision. So based on your
[210:12] use case. Okay. So I'm creating a few
[210:15] more missing values after creating a
[210:18] copy of the data frame. So I'm creating
[210:20] a copy and from that copy I am dropping
[210:24] some more uh values. So creating some
[210:27] more missing values in the updated
[210:29] marks. This time you can see this is
[210:31] one. This is one. Uh other thing that
[210:34] you can do is instead of filling the
[210:36] missing values, you might want to drop
[210:39] the rows which have missing values. So
[210:41] let's say I want to drop these two rows
[210:44] which have the missing values. So that
[210:46] can be done by using the drop NA
[210:48] function. So the drop NA function
[210:50] removes the missing values instead of
[210:52] filling it with the average or the
