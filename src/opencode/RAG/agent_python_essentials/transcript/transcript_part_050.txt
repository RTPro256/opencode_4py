[107:33] using underscores. Okay. So this is a
[107:35] camel case. P is capital. D is capital.
[107:38] So avoid using underscores. Although
[107:40] this is not wrong, Python will not throw
[107:43] an error in this case, but it is against
[107:46] the PEP 8 style guidelines. Next
[107:49] example, uh we should be adding a single
[107:51] space around the operators for better
[107:53] readability. If you see here, uh there
[107:55] are three operators being used. Okay,
[107:57] one is the equality sign. The other is
[108:00] the plus sign, then the last is the
[108:03] multiplication sign. So these three
[108:05] operators, but there are no spaces. So
[108:07] ideally we should be using spaces enough
[108:10] spaces enough means just one not too
[108:12] many. So you should be separating the
[108:16] operators and the operents okay by a
[108:19] single space at least on both sides.
[108:22] Another example here is about the
[108:24] indentation and the line length. So in
[108:26] this case if you see we should be using
[108:29] consistent indentations. So all the
[108:32] indentation should be exactly four white
[108:34] spaces and the total line length should
[108:38] be less than 79 characters. So if your
[108:42] line tends to including comments tends
[108:44] to exceed 79 characters better break
[108:47] that line even that means breaking the
[108:50] comments that's perfectly fine and
[108:52] acceptable. So functionality wise both
[108:55] are same. Functionality wise both are
[108:57] same but make sure that you are using
[108:59] exactly four white spaces for the first
[109:01] indent and then eight white spaces for
[109:04] the next indent and so on. It cannot be
[109:06] three white spaces and then four white
[109:08] spaces uh you cannot randomly increase
[109:11] or decrease the number of white spaces
[109:13] here. So if you see if you try to run
[109:16] this code with inconsistent number of
[109:18] white spaces this might even give you an
[109:21] error. So you should also use blank
[109:24] lines while defining functions and
[109:26] classes. At least two blank lines. Here
[109:29] I've defined a function and a class but
[109:31] there is no space between the class
[109:33] definition and the function definition.
[109:35] So here I've got two line breaks. Okay.
[109:38] before I start defining my okay so again
