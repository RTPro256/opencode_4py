[49:10] allow us to repeat task efficiently
[49:12] without writing tons of repetitive code.
[49:15] Today we'll learn how to make our code
[49:17] smarter, more efficient, and much easier
[49:19] to manage. Let's jump right in. So
[49:23] what's exactly are looping constructs in
[49:25] Python? These are tools that allow us to
[49:27] repeat a block of code as long as a
[49:30] specific condition is met. Think of it
[49:33] like an instruction that says keep doing
[49:35] this until I tell you to stop. This can
[49:38] help us automate repetitive tasks,
[49:41] process data more easily, and solve
[49:43] complex problems with fewer lines of
[49:45] code. Let me give you a simple scenario.
[49:48] Imagine Jake wants to print his name 10
[49:51] times. Now, he could write out print
[49:53] Jake 10 times, but that's pretty
[49:56] tedious, right? This is where loops come
[49:58] in handy. Instead of writing that code
[50:01] over and over, we could use a loop to do
[50:03] this for us. Using a loop, we can tell
[50:06] Python to print Jake's name 10 times
[50:08] with just a couple of lines of code.
[50:10] This makes our work faster, easier, and
[50:13] much more elegant. So, when do we use
[50:16] loops? Well, there are several
[50:18] situations where loops come in handy.
[50:20] First, repetitive tasks like our example
[50:23] of printing a name multiple times. Next,
[50:25] processing user input when you want to
[50:28] keep asking questions until you get a
[50:30] valid answer. iterating over data
[50:32] structures like lists or dictionaries,
[50:35] conditional repetition where you keep
[50:37] doing something until a condition is
[50:40] met, and even simulations or games where
[50:42] repeated actions are a part of some
[50:44] experience. Loops save us a lot of time,
[50:47] especially when our task grow.
[50:51] Let's take a closer look at the types of
[50:53] loops in Python. In Python, we have two
[50:55] main types of loops, while loop and for
[50:58] loops. First, we'll discuss about the
[51:00] while loop. While loop is used when we
[51:03] don't know exactly how many times we
[51:05] need to repeat the task. It keeps going
[51:08] on until the condition is no longer met.
[51:11] For example, you might use a while loop
[51:14] to ask a user for input until they
