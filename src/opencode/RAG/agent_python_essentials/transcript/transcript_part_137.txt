[296:55] user is redirected to an authorization
[296:57] server to grant the access. Then, the
[296:59] user authenticates and authorizes the
[297:02] access. In the next step, the server
[297:03] returns an authorization code which the
[297:06] application can exchange for an access
[297:08] token. And finally, this access token is
[297:12] used to make API requests on behalf of
[297:14] the user. OOTH is more complex to
[297:17] implement but offers enhanced security
[297:20] making it ideal for situations where
[297:22] users need to grant access securely to
[297:25] their data. Let's summarize the
[297:27] learnings from this module. First, we
[297:29] have learned that APIs are essential
[297:30] tools for enabling communication between
[297:33] different software systems.
[297:34] Understanding the basics of restful APIs
[297:36] and JSON data formats is crucial.
[297:39] Python's request library provides a
[297:41] straightforward way to interact with
[297:42] APIs. Adhering to best practices ensures
[297:45] that your applications are robust and
[297:47] secure. APIs play a significant role in
[297:49] working with LLMs and building agents.
[297:52] Providing access to advanced
[297:53] functionalities and data.
[297:57] Hello and welcome to the video on
[297:59] building APIs with Flask and fast API.
[298:02] In this video, we'll explore how to
[298:04] create restful APIs using two popular
[298:07] Python frameworks, Flask and Fast API.
[298:10] We'll cover the basics of setting up the
[298:12] endpoints, handling get and post
[298:15] requests and also testing our APIs using
[298:18] tools like Postman.
[298:20] We'll also compare Flask and fast API to
[298:23] help you understand which might be
[298:25] better choice for your projects. Flask
[298:28] is a microwave framework written in
[298:29] Python. It is called a micro framework
[298:32] because it doesn't require exotic tools
[298:35] or libraries making it lightweight and
[298:38] easy to get started with. When we say
[298:41] flask is used for building web
[298:42] applications and APIs, we mean it can
[298:46] handle both front end that is what we
[298:48] see in our browsers as well as back end
[298:51] which is the server side logic and data
[298:53] processing part of the web development.
