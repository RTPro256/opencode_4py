[156:08] default there are no labels. Okay. So
[156:10] label is none. So I have specified a
[156:12] label and all the custom values. So this
[156:15] will be the title of the plot. The title
[156:17] which comes above the plot canvas. So
[156:20] let me execute this. You can see this is
[156:22] the title line plot of sine waves. This
[156:25] is called as the y label. So what do you
[156:27] want to write in the Y labels? Okay,
[156:29] these are the Y-axis values. Similarly,
[156:32] you see this as the X label. Okay, so
[156:35] I'm providing the X labels and the Y
[156:38] labels here. If you want to increase the
[156:40] font size, you can do that by using the
[156:42] font size argument. So let me have a
[156:46] font size of maybe 12. And I'll increase
[156:50] the font size for the title. Let's say I
[156:52] want to go for 15. So you can now see
[156:56] these are slightly bigger in size
[156:58] compared to the the tick labels. These
[157:02] are my tick labels and you can see these
[157:04] are the ticks. So 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 these
[157:06] are the tick labels. Similarly these
[157:08] numbers that you see these are the Y
[157:10] tick labels. Okay. So by default they
[157:12] are in the font size of 10. So I made
[157:14] the label as 12. This label is 12 and
[157:17] you can see this line width is two and
[157:20] this font size is 15. Okay. You can also
[157:23] customize. So let's say I want to change
[157:26] this color to dodger blue. D O D G E R.
[157:29] Dodger blue. One of my favorite colors.
[157:32] And you can see a very nice light bluish
[157:34] color is there. So you can you know
[157:36] create all sort of exotic colors. You
[157:39] want to go with lime green. Okay. So
[157:41] green is one color. Lime green is
[157:43] another color. Okay. So let me just
[157:46] delete. So this is the normal green
[157:48] color. Uh this was the lime green color.
[157:50] Okay. So where do you find these names?
[157:52] Okay. So let's go to Google and search
[157:55] for Matt plot lib named colors. Okay. So
[158:03] click on the first link and here you go.
[158:06] These are the names of the colors that
[158:08] you can supply. Okay. So I was using
[158:11] these color this dodger blue. Can you
[158:13] see? And one of the green lime green is
[158:18] present somewhere. Yeah. So this is lime
[158:20] color and lime green should also be
