[29:03] the operator is applied. Python provides
[29:06] several types of operators. The
[29:08] arithmetic operators for basic math.
[29:11] Comparison operators to compare values
[29:14] like greater than or equal to. Logical
[29:16] operators for combining multiple
[29:19] conditions. Bitwise operators for
[29:21] working with bits. Assignment operators
[29:24] for assigning values. Identity operators
[29:27] to check if two variables refer to the
[29:29] same object. These operators allow us to
[29:32] perform complex calculations and make
[29:35] our code much more powerful. For
[29:38] example, you could use a comparison
[29:40] operator to check if a student score is
[29:43] greater than 50 and then use a logical
[29:45] operator to decide what to do next. It's
[29:49] time to practice using operators. Let's
[29:52] open our Python editor and try out some
[29:55] arithmetic and comparison operations.
[29:58] So, we have already learned the concept
[30:00] of variables and data types. Now, we'll
[30:02] proceed to operators in Python. I'll
[30:04] double click this file and open it.
[30:07] So as we have already seen there are uh
[30:09] different types of operators in Python.
[30:11] Arithmetic operators for mathematical
[30:13] computations, comparison operators,
[30:15] logical operators, bitwise operators and
[30:17] so on. Let's experiment with some of
[30:20] these operators. So here I'm creating
[30:22] four variables. A with a value of 15
[30:24] which is an integer. B with a value of 8
[30:27] again an integer. C with a value of
[30:28] 15.5. Uh C will be a float. And S is
[30:33] hello with single quotes. It's a string.
[30:36] So let me execute this. Okay. So these
[30:39] are the most common arithmetic operators
[30:41] available in Python. Plus is used for
[30:44] addition, minus for subtraction. This is
[30:47] asterisk uh used for multiplication of
[30:50] two numbers. This is for division of two
[30:52] numbers. This is the modulo operator. Uh
[30:54] this will give you the remainder after
[30:57] division. Uh for exponentiation you can
[31:00] use two asterics. Okay. And this is for
[31:04] flow division. Flow division typically
[31:06] gives you the quotient part after
[31:09] division. So let's see addition of a and
[31:13] b. I'm subtracting a from b.
