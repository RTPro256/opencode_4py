[290:31] can check the status code to determine
[290:33] if the request was successful. A status
[290:36] code of 200 indicates success. The
[290:39] headers attribute contain the response
[290:42] headers and text gives you the raw
[290:45] content as a string. If the response is
[290:47] in JSON format, you can parse it using
[290:49] the response.json function. Always check
[290:52] the status code before processing the
[290:54] response to handle errors appropriately.
[290:58] Making post requests. Post requests are
[291:01] used to send data to a server. For
[291:03] example, while submitting forms or
[291:05] uploading data to an API. You can
[291:08] include data in the requests using the
[291:10] data or JSON parameters. When sending
[291:13] JSON data, it is common to set the
[291:15] content type header to application/json.
[291:18] The request library handles this for you
[291:20] when you use this JSON parameter.
[291:23] Interacting with LLMs via APIs typically
[291:26] involves sending a prompt or input text
[291:29] to the API which processes it using a
[291:32] sophisticated language model and then
[291:34] returns the generated response. For
[291:36] example, using OpenAI API, you can send
[291:39] a prompt and receive a completion. When
[291:41] an API returns data in JSON format, you
[291:44] can parse it using response.json JSON
[291:47] function which converts it into a Python
[291:49] dictionary. You can then access
[291:51] individual data points using keys just
[291:54] like with any dictionary. If the data is
[291:57] nested, you might need to access
[291:59] multiple levels of keys. Understanding
[292:01] the structure of JSON response is
[292:03] essential for correctly parsing and
[292:05] using the data.
[292:09] Let's start with the best practices for
[292:10] working with APIs. Read the
[292:12] documentation. Always make sure to
[292:14] thoroughly read and understand the API
[292:17] documentation. This will help you
[292:18] understand the endpoints, parameters,
[292:21] and authentication methods used by the
[292:23] API. Handle errors gracefully. Implement
[292:26] robust error handling to manage issues
[292:29] such as connectivity problems, incorrect
[292:32] inputs, or server errors. Respect the
[292:34] rate limits. Most APIs have rate limits
