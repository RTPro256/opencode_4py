[170:46] here at. So let's see the slice labels
[170:49] A, B, C and D. And then this is
[170:52] basically the fraction of your circle
[170:55] that will be occupied by these labels.
[170:59] Okay. So 40% of the circle will be
[171:01] occupied by A. Another 25% by B. C will
[171:06] occupy 20 20% and the last 15% will be
[171:10] occupied by D. So make sure that the sum
[171:12] of this will be equal to 100. Okay. And
[171:15] there is something interesting here. I
[171:17] have set an offset for the second bit
[171:19] and that's why the second
[171:22] piece appears to be slightly off. Okay.
[171:26] So that is explode in the exploded view
[171:29] that is highlighted. Basically if you
[171:31] want to highlight a particular section
[171:33] then you can do this explode option as
[171:37] well. So the main function being used
[171:39] here is pi. You can provide the slices
[171:42] basically. Okay. And then the slice
[171:44] labels
[171:46] explode options. If all by default all
[171:49] are zero means you'll get a flat pie
[171:51] chart. So this explode option gives you
[171:54] a 3D effect essentially. And then the
[171:57] label formatting this is done by this.
[172:00] Okay. And then whether you want the
[172:02] shadow. So you can see the shadow here.
[172:05] The shadow is given. So whether you want
[172:07] to have the shadow effect. So that gives
[172:09] me a 3D effect kind of thing. And then
[172:12] starting angle. Okay. 140 or you can
[172:14] provide 0 90 whatever angle. So from
[172:16] where your slides slices actually start.
[172:19] Okay. So see this angle here from here
[172:23] to here that's 140°. Okay. This angle is
[172:27] 140°. So that's where the first slice
[172:29] starts and then the second then the
[172:31] third and the last one.
[172:35] Now we have seen how to customize some
[172:37] of these things. Let's deep dive into
[172:39] customizing
[172:41] access limits. text grid lines and
[172:44] figure size and so on. Okay. So here
[172:47] I've again created a figure. I'm going
[172:49] to create two plots here. Plot one and
[172:52] plot two. You see that I have provided
[172:54] two different labels sinx and cos x. So
[172:57] make sure if you have multiple plots
[172:59] within the same canvas provide different
