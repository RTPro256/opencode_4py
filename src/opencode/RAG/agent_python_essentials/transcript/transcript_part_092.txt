[197:31] outputs. So this is the second row. You
[197:33] can see Sophia Smith's female 2278 and
[197:37] Python. And similarly you want to see
[197:40] the third row. So the third row uh two
[197:43] this two is basically the index and this
[197:46] one is actually the label. Okay. So as I
[197:49] just mentioned by default the labels and
[197:51] the indices for rows they are same. So
[197:55] right now there is no difference between
[197:57] these numbers but Python knows based on
[198:01] what function you are using. So lock
[198:04] means it is going to assume that this
[198:06] number that you are providing is
[198:07] actually a label and means this number
[198:10] that you are providing is an index.
[198:13] Okay. So 0 1 and two. So these are the
[198:17] so another good thing about the eyelock
[198:20] function is you can use that eyelock
[198:22] function to use multiple to fetch
[198:25] multiple rows and columns. So let's say
[198:28] I want to fetch the first five rows.
[198:30] Super colon means start from start and
[198:33] end one before five. So index 0 1 2 3 4.
[198:38] This is iO remember. So index location
[198:41] from 0 to 4. So 0 to 4 I'm getting.
[198:44] Yeah. So similarly you can also fetch
[198:47] columns. So DF doilock let's say you
[198:50] want to fetch all the rows and the first
[198:54] three columns that can be done. So all
[198:56] the rows and first three columns. So 0 1
[199:00] and two because it's a index location.
[199:03] So it will stop one before three that is
[199:06] two 0 1 2. So this is 0 1 and two. Okay.
[199:10] You can also use it with a keyword like
[199:12] minus one. So df do.log I log. So I want
[199:16] to fetch the last row. So last row means
[199:19] minus one. So this is your last row.
[199:21] Similarly, if you want to fetch the last
[199:23] column, that can be done. So last column
[199:25] is DF do.lock. So in that case, all rows
[199:28] of the last column. So this is all rows
[199:31] of the last column. You can see the last
[199:33] column is subject. Okay. So this is my
[199:36] subject column. You can see the subject
[199:39] column here. Yeah. So let me just write
[199:42] it down. So this is the last row and
[199:45] here fetch the last column.
[199:50] Okay, you can also add and modify
[199:52] columns. So right now what I'm going to
[199:54] do is let me show you the data frame
