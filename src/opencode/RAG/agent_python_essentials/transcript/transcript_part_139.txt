[301:14] at the port 5000/get
[301:17] data. That's the name of the endpoint we
[301:20] created here. Here is another endpoint
[301:22] which uses the get method for requesting
[301:24] inputs from the user. So the at the rate
[301:27] app route / square that is the name of
[301:30] the endpoint and the methods is equal to
[301:32] get again. So here this app endpoint
[301:36] needs a number from the user and by
[301:38] default that number is given to be zero.
[301:41] In case the user is not providing any
[301:43] input we'll be using zero. So what we
[301:45] are returning is the square of that
[301:48] number. So this is a dictionary mostly
[301:51] this is the same format as of your JSON.
[301:54] Finally we can run this app and access
[301:56] it from the browser window. You can see
[301:58] uh we have the local host colon the port
[302:01] number 5000/ square. So / square is your
[302:05] endpoint and question mark and beyond
[302:07] that we have the name of the parameter
[302:10] which is the number which the user has
[302:12] to provide equal to this is the actual
[302:14] number which the user has to provide 5
[302:16] 10 15 500 whatever that number is for
[302:19] which we want to calculate the square.
[302:21] Now in this example we have two
[302:22] endpoints one for the get and another
[302:26] for handling the post request. The slash
[302:28] get data uh route responds to the get
[302:31] request by returning a simple JSON
[302:34] message. The post data route handles the
[302:37] post requests. It retrieves the JSON
[302:40] data sent in the request body using the
[302:43] request dot get JSON function and
[302:47] returns a response that includes the
[302:50] received data. So by specifying the
[302:52] methods parameter in the app route
[302:54] decorator, we define which HTTP methods
[302:58] each endpoint accepts. Now there are
[303:00] several ways to access and test your API
[303:03] endpoints. First method is the browser
[303:06] address bar. This works only for the get
[303:08] requests. Simply type the full URL of
[303:11] your endpoint and press enter. The
[303:13] second method is using command line
[303:15] tools. You can use curl which is a
[303:18] command line tool for transferring data
[303:20] or you can use wget which is another
[303:22] command line tool. API testing tools
