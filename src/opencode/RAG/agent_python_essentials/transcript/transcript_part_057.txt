[122:11] histogram function np.histogram
[122:14] that helps you bucket the continuous
[122:16] data into bins for a basic frequency
[122:18] distribution. Now these functions while
[122:21] simple can be incredibly powerful for a
[122:24] quick look at how your data behaves
[122:27] before diving deeper with specialized
[122:29] libraries like pandas or seabon for
[122:31] visualizations. Finally there are
[122:33] numpy.random module which is where we
[122:36] generate random numbers for simulations
[122:38] randomized algorithms or even test data.
[122:40] The recommended approach is to create a
[122:42] random number generator using the
[122:44] np.random
[122:46] default RNG function. You can provide a
[122:49] seed whatever number the default is
[122:51] anyway 42 and this makes your results
[122:54] quite reproducible which is critical in
[122:56] many scientific and data science
[122:58] context. You can also sample from
[123:00] various distributions like normal
[123:02] uniform distribution or binomial
[123:05] distribution and many more.
[123:06] Additionally, you have the function
[123:08] called as shuffle and permutation which
[123:10] come in handy when you need to shuffle
[123:12] your data like randomizing the order of
[123:15] the rows in a data set or even create
[123:17] per permutations. Whether you are
[123:19] performing Monte Carlo simulations or
[123:21] just need a quick sample of your data
[123:23] for testing, the numpy.random module is
[123:26] the go-to function of your choice. This
[123:28] wraps up exploration on NumPai's key
[123:30] features from array creation to
[123:32] broadcasting to universal functions,
[123:34] linear algebra and even random sampling.
[123:37] Understanding these concepts will help
[123:38] you to write faster, cleaner code and
[123:41] give you a strong foundation in Python
[123:43] based data science.
[123:46] Hello and welcome back. In this video, I
[123:48] will demonstrate how do we use the numpy
[123:52] functions. I'll show you how to create
[123:54] and manipulate numpy arrays and
[123:57] matrices. We'll also perform vectorized
[123:59] arithmetic operations, use some
[124:02] statistical functions, and we will see
[124:05] how broadcasting works in numpy. We'll
