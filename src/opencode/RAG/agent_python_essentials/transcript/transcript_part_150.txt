[325:24] form and saved it separately as a HTML
[325:27] file. Right? So that form HTML has been
[325:30] separately created. So I'm not going to
[325:32] go ahead and open that HTML code and
[325:35] explain there. Please feel free yourself
[325:38] and uh let me know if you have any
[325:40] questions or doubts on that. you can
[325:42] take help of uh charg to explain the
[325:45] form uh HTML code because that is lot of
[325:49] HTML in that okay so these two things
[325:52] are clear one is the home HTML the form
[325:56] html will create a form where the user
[325:59] is expected to give two numbers as the
[326:02] input and finally if everything goes
[326:04] well the computation happens and the
[326:07] result is displayed in another HTML
[326:10] format okay so that result HTML is
[326:13] rendered along with your actual
[326:15] calculation result. If anything goes
[326:17] wrong here, it goes into the accept
[326:20] block and uh that is handled gracefully.
[326:23] So let me execute this. Okay. So I'll
[326:25] just click here simply. It goes to the
[326:28] home.html page. So this is essentially
[326:31] home.html.
[326:32] Um I'm clicking on this to go to my
[326:34] calculator app. I'll provide two numbers
[326:36] here. So let's say 1 2 3 4 5 is the
[326:38] first number. Second number is let's say
[326:40] 25. So first thing that will be done is
[326:44] this number will be divided by this
[326:46] number and the resultant number is 493.8
[326:49] and square root of that is 22.22. Right?
[326:53] So click on this and it goes back to the
[326:55] homepage. Right? So this entire thing
[326:57] once again let me show you the homepage
[326:59] was this the app root base. Click on
[327:04] this. It goes to which endpoint? It goes
[327:06] to the square root endpoint where the
[327:08] form.html is rendered. And once I have
[327:11] given some numbers, okay. And click on
[327:12] the submit button. This is my submit
[327:14] button. It goes to the results.html
[327:17] actually. So this is coming from the
[327:18] results HTML. Perfect. And if you notice
[327:21] something, there is 304 304 which never
[327:24] came before in any of the previous runs.
[327:27] 304 never came here. So this is
[327:29] something new. So 304 is not a error
[327:31] here. It's actually telling you that I'm
