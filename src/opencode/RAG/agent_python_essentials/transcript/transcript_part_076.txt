[162:33] I'll get dark red. And if I decrease a
[162:37] value to let's say 0.2, you can see
[162:40] these are light red. So it becomes more
[162:43] transparent. So lower values will lead
[162:45] to more transparent markers. So that if
[162:48] there are markers which are overlapping,
[162:49] you can still see them. Okay. So you can
[162:52] customize the opacity, title, label and
[162:55] those things are same. The new thing
[162:57] that here is grid. Okay. So grid is your
[162:59] these vertical and horizontal lines.
[163:01] These are called as grid. Okay. In the
[163:03] previous plot also we had the grid.
[163:05] Okay. If you don't want to display that
[163:07] grid, you can set it to false and grid
[163:11] will not be displayed. You can see those
[163:14] vertical lines and the horizontal lines
[163:16] which help us to track the values. They
[163:19] are gone. So you can customize this as
[163:21] per your choice and use case. So plt.tow
[163:26] will finally display that plot. Okay. So
[163:29] that should be the last mattplot lib
[163:31] function in any block of code which
[163:33] contains the plots. Okay. So here also
[163:36] the last function from mattplot liib is
[163:39] to display the plot. Okay. So first it
[163:41] creates the plot internally does all
[163:44] sort of customization and finally
[163:46] displays it. Okay. So that is the
[163:48] philosophy that we are going to follow
[163:50] for all the other plots as well. Okay.
[163:53] And here in the line plot let's say you
[163:55] want to also provide markers that is
[163:58] possible. Okay. So I'm going back to a
[164:01] solid line. And now let me provide some
[164:03] markers here. Okay. So here also if you
[164:05] want you can provide marker. Marker
[164:08] equal to let's say I want to go with
[164:11] square markers. Okay. This time I'll
[164:13] write S here. S for square. Okay. Okay,
[164:16] let's see what I get. You can see the
[164:18] square markers at all those X values.
[164:20] Now I had 100 X values. That's why I get
[164:23] so many squares here. Okay, these are so
[164:25] many squares. So S is for square. Here O
[164:29] is for circles. Okay, so there are other
[164:32] marker styles. So let's go to Google
[164:35] once again and search for Matt plot lib
[164:40] markers. Okay, so you'll get the marker
[164:43] reference here in the documentation. So
