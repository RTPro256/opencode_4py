[261:24] recommend you to get some uh basics on
[261:27] the SQL. So the query string is again
[261:30] executed and uh it is committed.
[261:34] Execution means it will execute and uh
[261:36] insert the data into the table
[261:39] temporarily and if there is any error,
[261:42] we can always roll back. Once there is
[261:45] no error, I can ask it to commit. So
[261:47] commit is like a permanent operation. So
[261:52] perfect. So data has been inserted. Now
[261:55] you can fire some query strings directly
[261:57] to your table. Okay. Here a simple query
[262:01] I am passing here is select star from
[262:04] students. That means I want to select
[262:06] all the rows from the students table. So
[262:09] I'm going to use the read_sql function
[262:12] from pandas. So I'm passing my query
[262:14] string and the connection object. Let's
[262:17] see. So after the data is fetged, it is
[262:21] directly converted into a data frame as
[262:23] you can see right. So this is the data
[262:26] which we created in into my students
[262:29] table. So you can also update some of
[262:32] the records or delete the records or
[262:35] filter your records based on all these
[262:38] SQL query commands. So here update
[262:41] student set Python marks. So basically
[262:42] what I'm doing is um there is one
[262:45] student called as Sophia Smith. I want
[262:47] to update her marks from 78
[262:52] to 95. Let's say there was some typo. So
[262:56] that is the number which I want to
[262:57] change. Okay. This 78 to 95. So Python
[263:01] marks equal to 95 where the name is
[263:04] Sophia Smith. So after changing you
[263:08] always should be committing your
[263:12] database once again. Okay, this is a
[263:14] good so for query commands you don't
[263:16] need to commit but for change commands
[263:18] or update commands you should always
[263:21] commit. So you can verify. So here I am
[263:25] passing my query. This query is the
[263:26] original query that is select star from
[263:29] student. So the same query I'm passing
[263:31] once again here with the connection
[263:33] object. Let's see if that has been
[263:34] changed. You can see that 78 has been
[263:37] changed to 95.
[263:39] Once you are done with all the SQL query
[263:41] operations on your uh in-memory
