[132:58] column side this colon means take all
[133:01] the columns. So give me the indices 02
[133:04] for the rows and all the columns. So
[133:06] let's see what I get since I asked for
[133:08] all the columns. So you can see that I'm
[133:11] able to get all the three columns and
[133:13] the first two rows. Okay. So what
[133:16] happens if I make this 2,
[133:20] zero? So the good thing is I'll get the
[133:23] last row and then the first row. So just
[133:26] watch the first row actually becomes the
[133:28] last row now. Okay. So you can see that
[133:31] these two rows actually flipped because
[133:33] the indices got flipped. So you can
[133:36] actually retrieve the rows and columns
[133:39] based on handpicked indices that you
[133:41] want. And that's the fancy indexing I'm
[133:44] talking about. Okay. Let's see how does
[133:46] the boolean indexing work. Here you'll
[133:48] provide a condition. So here what am I
[133:51] saying is give me all the elements of
[133:53] this two-dimensional array which are
[133:55] greater than four. So that will create a
[133:58] kind of a boolean mask. Boolean mask is
[134:00] nothing but an array of the same shape
[134:03] as this which has only trus and false.
[134:06] So trs at those position where this
[134:09] condition is met and false at all those
[134:11] positions where the elements are less
[134:14] than four. Okay, where this condition is
[134:16] not met essentially. So let me first
[134:18] print the boolean mask. You can see at
[134:20] these places I have a number which is
[134:23] greater than four. That's the exact
[134:25] meaning of the mask. And when you pass
[134:27] that mask, that mask becomes a boolean
[134:30] index. Essentially it's a boolean index.
[134:32] When you are passing that boolean index
[134:34] to that two-dimensional array, you will
[134:36] be able to fetch the elements which or
[134:39] against which you've got true here.
[134:43] Okay. All the elements which gave you
[134:45] true by using this boolean mask those
[134:48] elements will be fetched out okay by
[134:51] providing that boolean mask you can
[134:52] provide multiple conditions combined
[134:54] together. So in this case I'm asking to
[134:56] give me all the numbers which are
[134:58] greater than two and the same numbers
[135:00] must also be less than eight. So two
