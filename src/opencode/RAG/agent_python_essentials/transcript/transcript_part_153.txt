[332:25] clicking button on the top right. If you
[332:27] want you can provide some name to this
[332:29] key. Let's call it as AI agents. I'll
[332:32] create the secret key. Please make sure
[332:35] you copy this and uh you can open a
[332:38] notepad and keep it safely. We'll be
[332:41] needing this API key in the Jupyter
[332:44] notebooks. So save this file and then we
[332:47] are done. So let's get back. So execute
[332:50] this cell. It will ask you for the API
[332:52] key.
[332:54] So the API key we just created and
[332:57] copied. I'll just paste it here and
[333:00] press enter. We'll add the open API key
[333:03] to the environment variable here. In a
[333:05] similar way, we'll have to create the
[333:07] Germany API credentials. So there is a
[333:10] link here. You can get the API key by
[333:12] clicking here. So you will have to first
[333:15] login into your Google account. And from
[333:18] there on the top left you can see the
[333:20] get API key button. Here also you can
[333:22] see the get API key button. You can
[333:24] click on this. uh if you have never
[333:26] created a project you will have to
[333:27] create a project first or else you can
[333:30] select one of the existing projects and
[333:32] then click API key in this existing
[333:36] project. So similarly uh you can copy
[333:39] this key and uh save it. So once we have
[333:42] saved the Google Germany API key, we'll
[333:45] have to enter it here and then press
[333:48] enter. Let's execute this. So I have set
[333:52] my Google API key in the environment
[333:54] variable and we are good to go. So here
[333:57] I'm defining a function which will take
[334:00] the user prompt and the model. I'll be
[334:03] experimenting with GPT4 model and
[334:06] Germany pro models. Jiny pro model is
[334:09] from Google and GPT40 model is from
[334:11] OpenAI. So if the model is GPT40
[334:16] uh this is how we would be making the
[334:18] API call to the chat GPT API and this is
[334:24] how we are going to make the API call to
[334:26] the Google Germany API. Okay. So we need
[334:30] to define the uh role and the prompt. So
[334:34] prompt will be taken as the input from
[334:35] the user and the actual function is
[334:40] chat.comp completions.create.
[334:42] So we are going to pass the model and
