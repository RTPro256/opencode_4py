[220:01] So, let me decrease the marks by 10 to
[220:04] get the original marks because I have
[220:06] already added it two times. So I've
[220:10] decreased the marks by 10 to get the
[220:12] original marks. Now uh here I've written
[220:15] a custom function which I'm going to
[220:17] apply. Here I have applied a simple
[220:19] lambda function. But instead of applying
[220:22] a simple lambda function, you can also
[220:23] apply a custom function. So what does
[220:26] this do? So I'm going to assign the
[220:28] grades based on the marks. So if the
[220:30] marks is greater than 85 then I'm going
[220:33] to return a grade. If the marks is
[220:35] between 70 and 85 it is going to be b
[220:37] grade. And if the marks is less than 70
[220:40] it will be C grade. Okay. So after
[220:43] applying the function on this column I'm
[220:46] creating another column called as grade.
[220:49] So I've got the grades of the students
[220:51] as well. Now you can also map um values
[220:56] of a particular column to some other
[220:58] value. So let's say in this case I'm
[221:01] mapping males to zero and females to
[221:03] one. This can be done for uh label
[221:06] encoding typically used in machine
[221:08] learning. So I've created a new column
[221:10] called as gender new in which zeros
[221:13] represent males and ones represent
[221:16] females. So how was this done? By simple
[221:20] mapper. So your mapper is a dictionary
[221:23] where the original value becomes the key
[221:25] and the new value becomes the value. So
[221:27] you can also use pandas to handle dates
[221:29] and times. Let's see here. Here I've
[221:32] created a simple data frame uh with some
[221:34] names and dates. You can see these dates
[221:37] are actually strings. How do I know?
[221:39] Because of the data type present in the
[221:41] info. So the info gives me a object data
[221:44] type. So I can convert those strings
[221:48] into actual datetime objects by using
[221:51] the datetime function. So I'm converting
[221:53] the strings into a datetime. That's what
[221:56] the two datetime function does. And
[221:58] replacing the original column. So after
[222:00] doing that you can see visually it still
[222:03] looks very similar to what it is but
[222:06] here if you see the df.info now it is
[222:09] actually present in a datetime format.
