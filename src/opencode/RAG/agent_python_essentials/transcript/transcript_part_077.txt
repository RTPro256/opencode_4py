[164:45] you can take small circles or points you
[164:49] can see. So these are the actual styles
[164:52] that you will provide in the code and
[164:54] this is how it is actually displayed in
[164:55] the plots. Okay. So you can have some
[164:58] numbers as well. Octagon, pentagon,
[165:01] square. So I used this square just now.
[165:04] You can also go for pentagon, hexagon,
[165:06] asterics and so on. Okay. So these are
[165:09] all you know markers available to us.
[165:11] Okay. Okay. So let's move on to the next
[165:13] plot. Okay, so let's see how we can
[165:15] create bar plots. Bar plots is for
[165:18] categorical data. Okay, so for numerical
[165:20] data, you can go with the line charts or
[165:22] even the scatter plots. But if you have
[165:24] categorical data in your x-axis, okay,
[165:27] so ABCD will be there in your x-axis and
[165:29] their count or frequency is represented
[165:32] by values here. Okay, so now this ABCD
[165:35] could represent maybe the occupation of
[165:39] the customers in your data set. Okay. So
[165:42] this A can be student, B can be
[165:45] salaried, C can be retired and D can be
[165:48] non-employed. And then this is the
[165:50] actual count of those customers with
[165:52] those respective occupations. Okay, it
[165:55] could be as simple as gender also. It
[165:57] could so A B could be just male female
[166:00] and then the count of the male females.
[166:02] Okay, so you can have any number of
[166:04] categories and their corresponding
[166:05] frequencies or counts. So that is what
[166:08] the category and value means here. So
[166:11] again I'm creating my figure canvas. So
[166:13] this time I'm going to use the bar
[166:14] function. Categories that is basically
[166:16] the x-axis values will be populated by
[166:19] categories. The y values are going to
[166:21] come as counts. The values the height of
[166:24] the bar will be controlled by the
[166:25] values. Remember that. Okay. And then
[166:28] what should be the color for these bars?
[166:30] Let's have a look. So the color for
[166:32] these bars is definitely green because
[166:34] that is the color I have provided here.
[166:36] and then the title label. These are the
[166:38] same functions which we have seen. Okay.
[166:41] So these are common functions for any
[166:44] mattplot lip plot. So what should be
