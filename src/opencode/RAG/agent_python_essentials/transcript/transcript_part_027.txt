[57:55] loop. Okay. So if you see the
[57:57] indentation, okay, so this entire loop
[58:00] is indented within the outer loop. Okay.
[58:03] And this statement is indented within
[58:05] the inner loop. So this will be executed
[58:08] for every iteration of the inner loop.
[58:11] And for every iteration of the outer
[58:12] loop, this entire thing will be
[58:14] executed. Okay. So let's see what this
[58:18] does. In the outer loop, I am iterating
[58:21] from numbers 1 and two. It will stop
[58:24] before three. So it will go from one and
[58:26] stop at two. Now the inner loop uh is
[58:30] going to fetch the characters in ABC.
[58:33] Okay. So in the first iteration, the
[58:35] inner loop character would be A. The
[58:37] next iteration it would be B. In the
[58:39] next iteration, it would be C. Okay. So
[58:42] here in the first iteration of the outer
[58:44] loop this will be one and then this will
[58:46] be a then 1 b and then 1 c then it will
[58:50] go from 2 a then 2 b to 2 c that's how
[58:54] it will be let's see perfect so these
[58:58] three ones are coming because of the
[59:01] execution of the inner loop a b and c
[59:03] and then the outer loop increments to
[59:06] two automatically the default increment
[59:08] is one we have already seen yeah perfect
[59:10] now for a while loops. So here, let's
[59:13] say you want to execute a block of code
[59:16] without specifying initially how many
[59:19] times you want to execute. You just keep
[59:22] executing until some condition is met.
[59:25] So the code in the while loop will keep
[59:28] on executing as long as the while
[59:31] condition is set to be true. Okay, let's
[59:34] see. So in the below example we have
[59:37] initialized a variable with a number of
[59:38] zero and we want to increment its value
[59:41] and u the loop will continue to run only
[59:46] if the value is less than seven. Okay,
[59:48] so here I have a number equal to zero
[59:51] and every time before executing these
[59:54] statements, okay, before entering into
[59:57] the loop, I'm going to check whether
[59:58] this number's value is less than seven.
[60:01] Okay, so let's say I start with 10 and
[60:03] execute this. This number is already 10
[60:07] now. Okay, so what happens? The while
[60:10] loop condition itself becomes false and
