[101:03] example here. Um I have created an empty
[101:07] list okay and I want to store the
[101:10] squares of numbers in that list. So how
[101:13] do I do that? So what I have done here
[101:15] is I'm iterating over a range of 10
[101:19] numbers from 0 to 9 and for each of
[101:21] those number I'm storing or appending
[101:24] the square of that number into that
[101:27] empty list. So one by one with these
[101:29] iterations the numbers would be squared
[101:31] and appended to that empty list. Okay.
[101:34] So at the end I'll get a list containing
[101:37] the square of 10 numbers from 0 to 9. So
[101:40] we can condense these three lines of
[101:42] code in a single line by using list
[101:44] comprehensions. So this is my list
[101:46] comprehension here. So what I'm doing
[101:49] here is creating a list. You can see
[101:51] that square bracket means creation of a
[101:53] list and use the for loop as usual. And
[101:57] for i in range 10 save the value of the
[102:01] i square in that list. So you are
[102:03] creating the list and iterating over
[102:06] that range of 10 numbers in the same
[102:08] line of code. So this is what we call as
[102:10] a pythonic code. So these kind of
[102:13] pythonic codes are preferred over these
[102:16] kind of nave for loop codes. Another
[102:18] example here is let's say you want to
[102:20] access both the um index as well as the
[102:25] value of an iterable. Here my iterable
[102:27] is a list containing three alphabets
[102:31] here A, B, and C. Okay, this is a list
[102:33] and I'll be iterating over this list. So
[102:36] I want to have access to the index which
[102:38] is 0 1 and two as well as the values. So
[102:41] this is a for loop. I'm iterating over
[102:44] that data for item in data. Print the
[102:46] index comma item. I'm initializing the
[102:49] index to be zero and then I'm manually
[102:51] incrementing this index inside the for
[102:54] loop after accessing that index. So this
[102:57] is a very nice way of accessing the
[102:59] index and incrementing it. A better way
[103:02] is to use the enumerate function. So for
[103:06] item for index comma item in en in
[103:08] enumerate data. So what does the
[103:10] enumerate function do? Enumerate
[103:11] function will create an index plus it
[103:14] will give you a way to access the value
