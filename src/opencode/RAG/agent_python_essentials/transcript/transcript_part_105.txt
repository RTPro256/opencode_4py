[226:25] by using the drop NA function. So the
[226:28] drop any function removes the missing
[226:30] values instead of filling it with the
[226:33] average or the median value that you
[226:34] specify. So by default access is zero
[226:37] which means the entire row will be
[226:39] dropped. Okay, whichever row contains a
[226:42] single missing value that will be
[226:45] dropped. Okay, any means any single row
[226:48] which contains a missing value will be
[226:50] dropped. So if you want to drop columns
[226:52] then make sure that you keep access
[226:54] equal to one. So let me just drop and
[226:56] you can see that the row number four and
[226:58] the row number seven they got dropped.
[227:00] Yeah, row four and row seven are
[227:02] missing. Now good that we created a
[227:04] copy. So my original data frame is still
[227:07] the same unchanged. What if you have
[227:10] duplicates in your data frame? So I am
[227:12] creating a simple data frame with
[227:14] duplicates here. So this entire record
[227:17] is duplicated two times. You can see. So
[227:20] I want to drop the duplicates. So you
[227:23] can use the function drop duplicates. So
[227:25] by default again it will drop the rows
[227:28] and by default again it will have the in
[227:31] place option which is set to false. So
[227:33] again you can set in place equal to true
[227:36] or type cast it back to the original
[227:38] data frame. So after dropping replace
[227:41] your df2. So that is another option or
[227:44] you use the in place equal to true
[227:45] either of. So I have dropped my uh
[227:48] duplicate rows and uh you can also do
[227:53] some operations on your strings. So for
[227:55] example here the subject names I want to
[227:59] convert them into lower case. So I'm
[228:02] type casting the subject values into a
[228:05] string and then converting that string
[228:07] into a lower case and then replacing the
[228:09] original column. So after converting the
[228:12] string values into lower case, I'm
[228:15] replacing my original column. So that's
[228:18] how I get here. So the subject now is
[228:21] becoming in lower case. So all these
[228:24] operations you can do depending on your
[228:25] use case. Now let's have a look how can
[228:28] we merge and join data frames. I'm
[228:30] creating a couple of dummy data frames.
