[152:07] operations. We have done logarithmic
[152:09] trigonometry functions. Along with that,
[152:10] rounding functions, comparison and
[152:12] logical operations. I've also
[152:14] demonstrated broadcasting and linear
[152:16] algebra functions. Finally, we also saw
[152:18] some of the random generator functions.
[152:21] Thank you. Hello everyone and welcome to
[152:24] this session on the mattplot lab basics
[152:27] hands-on. So in this notebook I will
[152:29] demonstrate the most commonly used
[152:31] plotting functions in mattplot liib and
[152:33] how to customize these plots. So let's
[152:36] get started. So first we need to install
[152:39] mattplot liib if it is not there by
[152:41] using pipe install mattplot liib. Most
[152:43] of the Anaconda installations come with
[152:45] Mattplot liib pre-installed and also
[152:48] your collab comes with Mattplot lib
[152:51] pre-installed.
[152:53] So let me see what is the version of
[152:56] Mattplot liib in my machine that comes
[152:58] to 3.1.
[153:00] Okay. So now let's import the piplot
[153:03] module from mattplot liib and assign it
[153:06] as an alias of plt. So piplot is
[153:10] basically used for one-dimensional
[153:11] plotting. If you want to go for
[153:13] two-dimensional or 3D plots, you have
[153:16] different modules for that. I'm also
[153:18] importing numpy as np to create some
[153:21] arrays which will be actually plotting
[153:23] in mattplot lab. Now in the earlier
[153:25] versions of jupyter notebook, you will
[153:28] have to unccommend this line and run
[153:31] this mattplot li in line so that the
[153:33] plots appear within the jupyter
[153:36] notebooks. But it is actually no longer
[153:38] needed if you are running the most
[153:40] recent versions of the Jupyter notebooks
[153:42] or even using Google's collab. Okay. So
[153:45] I'll just keep it for now for backwards
[153:47] compatibility let's say. So let me
[153:49] create a sample data here by using the
[153:51] numpy function lin space that is
[153:53] linearly spaced numbers starting from
[153:55] zero ending at 2 pi and both inclusive.
[153:59] I'm going to create 98 numbers in
[154:01] between. So the starting and the ending
[154:04] numbers are anyway included. So total
