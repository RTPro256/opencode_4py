[130:42] numbers with a step size of two. So
[130:44] every second element will be picked up.
[130:46] Okay. Now let's see how does indexing
[130:48] and slicing work with multi-dimensional
[130:51] arrays and matrices. So let me first
[130:53] create a 2D matrix. So here I have got
[130:56] the numbers 1 2 9 arranged in a 3 + 3
[130:59] format. So three rows and three columns.
[131:01] These are the rows 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.
[131:04] These are the three rows and these are
[131:06] the columns 1 47 28 and 369. Now here I
[131:10] want to extract the elements with the
[131:13] index one two. So this is my row index
[131:16] and this is the column index. Now what
[131:18] is the row index? So this is the first
[131:21] row with an index of zero. The second
[131:24] row will have a index of one and the
[131:27] third row will have a index of two.
[131:29] Okay. So I am asking it to fetch me the
[131:33] first indexed row that means the second
[131:36] row. So this row has got the index of
[131:39] one. So second row and column index is
[131:42] two. The first column will have a index
[131:45] of zero. Second column index has one.
[131:47] And the third column will have a index
[131:49] of two. So essentially you are saying
[131:51] give me the element present in the
[131:53] second row and the third column. So here
[131:56] you can see it intersects at six.
[131:59] Perfect. You can also provide a range of
[132:01] row indices and column indices. Okay. So
[132:04] 0 col 2 means it will take rows 0 and 1
[132:09] two will be excluded. So rows index 01
[132:12] and column index 1 and two because again
[132:15] three will be excluded. So row index 01
[132:18] means the first two rows and column
[132:20] index 1 2 will be the last two columns.
[132:24] So first two rows and last two columns
[132:27] essentially will give me 2 3 5 6. Let's
[132:31] see. So this is exactly what we call as
[132:33] two-dimensional slicing. Okay. You can
[132:36] also provide handpicked row column
[132:39] indices. So in this case let's say I
[132:41] want to select the elements from the
[132:43] first row and the last row. Last row
[132:45] will have index two in this case. So
[132:48] that is the indices you are providing
[132:49] and colon means take all the columns. So
[132:52] here you are providing the row indices
[132:55] which is 02 and colon means here in the
