[341:28] connection because we are going to
[341:30] access the API calls from hugging face
[341:33] servers. You will also need the hugging
[341:36] face account and the API key. So first
[341:38] let's see how we can create the hugging
[341:42] face key. So you can go to this link
[341:45] which will take you to the account page
[341:47] from where you can get the access
[341:49] tokens. Okay. On the left side you can
[341:52] see the access tokens. So I already have
[341:55] created a couple of keys but let me
[341:58] create uh a new key. So click on this
[342:01] button and there will be three options
[342:04] fine grain, read and write. For most of
[342:06] the task you will be doing uh on the
[342:09] hugging face platform you will be
[342:12] needing the read token type. This way
[342:15] you will be able to make API calls to
[342:18] all the publicly available models on
[342:21] hugging face. all the models which are
[342:24] available for inference APIs using the
[342:27] right you will be able to actually
[342:29] upload your own model to the hugging
[342:31] phase repository if you want to do that
[342:33] and in the fine grain you can provide
[342:36] fine grained access to your repo for
[342:40] read and write access okay so we'll go
[342:43] with the read only token type which is
[342:46] the most common token type you are going
[342:48] to use in this course so I can provide
[342:50] some name let's say AI agents
[342:53] Okay. And then I'll provide so this is
[342:56] the token and uh this is the token name
[342:59] you can say and this has a readonly
[343:01] access to all your organization
[343:03] resources and we'll be able to make
[343:06] inference calls on your behalf and
[343:08] that's exactly what we are looking for.
[343:11] So I'll go ahead and create token. I'll
[343:13] be presented with some key here. So
[343:17] don't forget to copy this and save it
[343:20] exactly the way we saved the openi
[343:23] access key and then we'll come back to
[343:26] the notebook. So here let's execute
[343:29] this. You will be asked to paste that
[343:32] key and press enter. So we'll be using
[343:36] the request library to make uh inference
[343:38] API calls to the hugging face serverless
[343:41] APIs. So first we'll need to create
[343:43] headers just as we did in the last
