[321:03] passing it to the server using this data
[321:05] dictionary. Okay. So you can use the
[321:09] post method pass the URL and also the
[321:12] data. Okay. And then collect the
[321:14] response from the server and extract the
[321:17] text part from the response. Let's see.
[321:20] Super. So this is the response that I've
[321:22] got from the server. And there are many
[321:24] more things in the response. Let's
[321:25] quickly have a look. The first one is
[321:28] headers. So you can check the headers.
[321:33] Okay. So the response header has the
[321:36] date and time of the request when it was
[321:38] given to the server. Okay. The content
[321:40] type, the character set, the content
[321:42] length 43 characters essentially and
[321:45] whether the connection is closed
[321:47] currently or not. And this is the work
[321:49] zug server. This is the flask server
[321:51] essentially. Okay. Otherwise the URL of
[321:53] the actual server would be displayed
[321:55] here once the application is hosted on a
[321:58] real server. Right? Uh you can also see
[322:02] response
[322:04] dot tab. You can see the other things
[322:07] like history and the JSON format of the
[322:10] response. Let's go for the status. Okay,
[322:14] this is something status code. So if
[322:16] everything is successful, they should
[322:18] return 200. So status code 200 means the
[322:21] request was successfully fulfilled by
[322:23] the server without any error. Okay. And
[322:26] there are many more things you can
[322:27] explore. Fine. So coming back to the
[322:29] app, let me stop this. I have created a
[322:32] small variation of this flask app. So in
[322:34] this uh this flask endpoint is being
[322:37] modified to accept JSON data now. Okay.
[322:40] So I'll not be using the dictionary uh
[322:43] input. In fact, if you see here, the
[322:46] main difference is the get from form
[322:49] data. Instead of getting the form data
[322:52] as a string, it will get it in the JSON
[322:55] format. So request.get JSON. Okay. So
[322:59] this is the field it will be interested
[323:01] in to extract the message and from there
[323:05] the response is also JSONified. So here
[323:08] the response was directly given as a
[323:11] HTML format but here now I'm JSONifying
[323:15] the entire response. So the response
