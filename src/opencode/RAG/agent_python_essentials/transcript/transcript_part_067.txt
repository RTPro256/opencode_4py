[143:51] Nearest integer to this should be two.
[143:54] And the nearest integer to this should
[143:56] be three. Let's see. Yeah correct. So
[143:58] floor will round off the values to the
[144:01] lower integer. Okay. So and seal will
[144:04] round to the higher integer. Okay.
[144:06] Truncate will simply exclude the decimal
[144:10] points the values after the decimal
[144:12] point. So simply 75 will be incl uh
[144:16] ignored. 22 would be ignored.
[144:19] 58 would be ignored and so on. Okay. So
[144:21] that's how you get these numbers. The
[144:23] signs will be retained. However, now
[144:25] let's see some of the comparison and
[144:27] logical universal functions. Again, I've
[144:29] got my arrays here 1 2 3 4 and 22 222.
[144:32] So, I can actually compare whether each
[144:35] element of A is less than each element
[144:38] of B. This again works element wise.
[144:41] Here you are checking for each element
[144:43] of A. Is it greater than each element of
[144:45] B? Again, you are checking for the
[144:47] equality of the corresponding elements
[144:49] in A and B and not equality. Okay, let
[144:52] me see. Okay. Now these can be made
[144:54] simpler by also saying a less than b.
[144:57] That also works. You can see that the
[145:00] result is very similar. Okay. To this
[145:04] for equality you can go with 2 *
[145:07] equality sign. So you are checking for
[145:09] the equality. This result should be same
[145:11] as this. Okay. And for none equality
[145:15] this should be written as this
[145:18] exclamation equal to. So this is not
[145:20] equal to b. You can see the result and
[145:23] greater than equal to can be written as
[145:25] greater than equal to B. So this result
[145:28] would be again same as this. The same
[145:30] thing in the logical format. Okay. Okay.
[145:33] Now statistical and aggregation
[145:35] functions. I'm creating a simple array 1
[145:37] to9 numbers in a two dimensional format.
[145:40] So I want to calculate the sum of all
[145:42] the elements. So np dots sum function
[145:45] all the elements sum from 1 to 9. Okay.
[145:48] here the mean of all the elements the
[145:51] standard deviation of all the elements
[145:52] and the variance of all the elements
[145:54] okay that entire array so sum is 45 mean
[145:58] is five standard deviation 2.58 and the
