[337:01] user prompt is exactly the same. Uh the
[337:03] model name has been changed to Germany
[337:05] pro. Let's see what story Google Germany
[337:09] makes. So the persona identified by
[337:13] Google Germany is about I think Emily
[337:17] Carter here. So I think the story is
[337:20] about Emily Carter in this case and you
[337:24] can take your time reading this story.
[337:27] Now let's try out uh zeroshot prompting
[337:30] basically we'll ask some questions to
[337:34] the model and we will expect the
[337:37] replies. So this function display and
[337:41] markdown is being imported to make a
[337:44] prettier display of the model's
[337:47] response.
[337:49] So again using the get completion
[337:51] function I'm passing the prompt as
[337:53] explain generative AI in two bullet
[337:54] points very short and crisp. So let's
[337:58] fetch the response and display that
[338:00] response in a nice manner. Okay. So
[338:05] these are the two bullet points I have
[338:06] received from the GPT4 model. Generative
[338:09] VI refers to algorithms based on machine
[338:11] learning models like neural networks
[338:13] that can create new content such as
[338:15] text, images, music or code and so on
[338:17] and so on.
[338:18] Let's see what is the response from
[338:20] Germany model. I've changed the model
[338:22] name here. So Germany model is giving me
[338:24] even more crisp response. Genative vi is
[338:28] a type of AI that can create new data or
[338:30] content from scratch just such as
[338:32] generating images, text or music. Super.
[338:36] So we'll take more examples of uh
[338:38] prompting or basically using the uh APIs
[338:42] from different different models in the
[338:44] next notebook. Okay.
[338:48] Hi and welcome back. So in this hands-on
[338:52] exercise, we will do some prompt
[338:55] engineering with open-source large
[338:57] language models. Uh you using hugging
[339:00] face serverless APIs. Basically hugging
[339:03] phase is a repository of various large
[339:06] language models. We can either download
[339:09] these models from hugging face
[339:12] repository or we can directly call these
[339:16] models which are hosted on the hugging
[339:18] face servers. So in this notebook we
