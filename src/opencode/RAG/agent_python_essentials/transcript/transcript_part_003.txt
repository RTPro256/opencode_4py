[04:19] tutorials, forums, and even solutions to
[04:22] problems you might face, making the
[04:25] learning curve much smoother. Secondly,
[04:28] Python syntax is very easy to understand
[04:31] which allows data scientists to focus on
[04:33] solving complex problems rather than
[04:35] spending too much time on intricacies of
[04:38] coding. It is also open source which
[04:40] means it is free to use and there's a
[04:43] continuous stream of improvements for
[04:45] developers from all over the world.
[04:48] Another big advantage is Python's rich
[04:51] collection of libraries like pandas,
[04:54] numpy, mattplot lib and scikitlearn.
[04:57] These libraries make tasks like data
[05:00] manipulation, visualization and machine
[05:02] learning easier and more efficient. The
[05:05] widespread use of Python in data science
[05:08] also translates into plenty of job
[05:10] opportunities which is another huge
[05:12] plus. Before we start coding, it's
[05:15] important to set up your system
[05:16] properly. For data science, many
[05:19] developers prefer working in an
[05:21] integrated environment like Jupyter Lab
[05:24] or Jupyter Notebook.
[05:26] Jupyter Lab allows you to write,
[05:28] execute, and document Python code all in
[05:32] one place, making it perfect for data
[05:34] analysis and visualization.
[05:37] We'll walk through the steps of
[05:38] installing and setting up Jupyter Lab
[05:41] which will ensure you have the right
[05:43] environment for working with Python
[05:45] throughout this course. Now let's go to
[05:48] Google and search for Anaconda.
[05:52] We'll click on the first link
[05:54] and this is the web page from where you
[05:56] can start downloading Anaconda
[05:59] distribution for Python. On this page
[06:01] you can find the link to download the
[06:03] Anaconda distribution. So if you see
[06:06] here below the submit button, there is a
[06:08] skip registration uh link. Let's skip
[06:11] the registration and straight away go to
[06:13] the download page. So this is the
[06:15] download page. Based on your operating
[06:17] system, you can click on the links to
[06:19] download the installer files. So here
[06:22] I'm using a Windows system. I'll click
