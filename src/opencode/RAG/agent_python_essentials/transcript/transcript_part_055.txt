[118:02] to flatten your arrays and matrices. And
[118:04] finally, the transpose function to flip
[118:06] the axes rows into columns and so on.
[118:08] There is a dype argument which can be
[118:11] used to fetch the data type of the
[118:13] elements present within the numpy array.
[118:15] Whereas you have the as type function
[118:18] which is used to change the data type of
[118:20] the elements within the numpy array. And
[118:23] that is also called as type casting.
[118:25] Mastering these basics is a key to
[118:28] getting the most of NumPy. Broadcasting
[118:31] is one of the most powerful features in
[118:32] NumPy. It's it lets you perform
[118:36] arithmetic operations between arrays of
[118:38] different shapes by automatically
[118:40] stretching them along any dimension with
[118:43] length one or no dimension. So for
[118:45] example, if you add a scalar, let's say
[118:48] five to a two-dimensional array, the
[118:50] numpy effectively replicates that scalar
[118:53] across the entire shape of the array to
[118:56] make that operation successful. Let's
[118:58] consider another quick example here.
[119:00] Here you have an array A which has a
[119:03] shape of three and B which has a shape
[119:06] of 3, 1. Essentially A is
[119:09] one-dimensional whereas B is two
[119:11] dimensional with three rows and one
[119:12] column. So these numbers 10 20 30 are
[119:15] present in one column. It's essentially
[119:17] a column vector. Whereas a is
[119:19] one-dimensional object. So now if you
[119:21] want to have an operation between them.
[119:23] Let's consider a plus b. Okay. So you
[119:26] are adding a one-dimensional numpy array
[119:29] with a two-dimensional numpy array. So
[119:31] in this case the numpy will stretch a or
[119:33] b as needed. So the shapes become
[119:35] compatible for the operation to be
[119:37] successful. So the final result is a 3
[119:40] +3 matrix. So when used correctly,
[119:42] broadcasting saves a ton of code and can
[119:45] keep your calculations very efficient.
[119:48] So it is also important to understand
[119:50] the rules of matching these shapes from
[119:52] the trailing dimension so as to avoid
[119:55] mismatch and errors. Now let's talk
[119:58] about linear algebra. So many data
