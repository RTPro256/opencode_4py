[266:15] next video we will see how to circumvent
[266:18] this process. We'll create environment
[266:22] variables for all these database
[266:24] configurations and uh using user access
[266:28] keys. But for now to keep things simple
[266:32] let's go ahead. Okay. So let me execute
[266:34] this. And now I'm going to use the
[266:37] connect function from pi MySQL. Pass all
[266:40] the details to that connect function and
[266:44] uh start my connection. So if this
[266:48] message is printed means I am already
[266:50] connected. There is no error here. Just
[266:54] as we did in the previous noteboard.
[266:56] Okay. We are going to create a
[266:58] connection cursor which is going to
[267:00] execute my SQL queries. So once my
[267:03] connection cursor is created, I'm
[267:05] passing the same simple uh select star
[267:08] from students. So my students database
[267:10] currently is now on AWS RDS instance.
[267:14] I've got I think eight records in that.
[267:18] So I'm limiting to first five. Okay. So
[267:21] I'm fetching the first five rows
[267:22] essentially and then fetching all those
[267:26] five rows and then printing row by row.
[267:29] Once you are done, you can close the
[267:32] connections. Okay. So this is how it
[267:35] comes up. So you can see that each row
[267:38] is fetched as a dictionary. Okay. Each
[267:42] row is fetched as a dictionary. I have
[267:44] student ID, the name of the student, the
[267:46] age, statistics, Python, machine
[267:48] learning and deep learning marks. Right
[267:50] now let's see how can we use the MySQL
[267:52] connector. So first uh you'll have to
[267:55] install that. Once it is installed, I'm
[267:57] importing that connector and also the
[268:00] error class from that MySQL connector.
[268:04] Now we'll try to establish a connection.
[268:06] It's a good programming practice to uh
[268:09] establish your connection within a try
[268:11] accept block so that if there is any
[268:15] issue or error which occurs while
[268:18] connecting to your remote database. This
[268:21] error could be because of the invalid
[268:23] host name or the database name, the
[268:26] username is not correct or the password
[268:28] is invalid or the port name is wrong. It
[268:30] could be any of these five reasons. You
[268:33] will get an appropriate error. you will
