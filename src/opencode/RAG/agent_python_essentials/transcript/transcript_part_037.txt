[79:54] So I'm just changing this function so
[79:56] that the default value is removed. And
[79:58] now you can see this one works because
[80:01] anyway it is taking some input argument
[80:03] which is mapped to name. But here this
[80:05] will throw an error. One required
[80:08] positional argument is missing. Okay.
[80:10] And that required positional argument is
[80:13] name. And since the value of the name is
[80:15] missing, this is the error you are
[80:17] getting. Okay. So to encounter such
[80:20] scenarios you can provide some default
[80:23] values that can be used if the required
[80:26] value of a particular input parameter is
[80:29] not provided at the time of the function
[80:32] call. Okay. If you made changes to the
[80:34] function do not forget to execute that
[80:38] block of code again so that the updated
[80:41] function goes to the memory and then you
[80:44] recall it. So just now we saw the
[80:46] concept of positional argument. Now
[80:48] there are two types of input argument.
[80:51] One is positional arguments and one is
[80:52] the keyword arguments. Okay. So what is
[80:55] the positional argument? Let's have a
[80:57] look into more details. So this is one u
[81:01] function which I'm creating math
[81:02] functions and this takes two numbers a
[81:05] smaller number and a larger number. So
[81:07] what does it return? It returns the
[81:09] difference between the larger number and
[81:11] the smaller number. Very simple
[81:12] function. So 4 and 16 and 16 and four.
[81:16] If you can see clearly the order in
[81:20] which you provide the values matter a
[81:23] lot. Okay. Because the difference
[81:24] between four and 16 is basically so if
[81:28] you see this four gets mapped to the
[81:30] smaller number and here 16 gets mapped
[81:32] to the larger number. But in this case
[81:34] what is happening? 16 is mapped to the
[81:37] smaller number and four is mapped to the
[81:40] larger number. So the same sequence is
[81:42] followed as it was declared in the
[81:45] function definition. Okay, that is
[81:47] exactly the concept of positional
[81:50] arguments. So the position of the input
[81:51] arguments matters. Okay, in which
[81:55] position you are giving the numbers, the
[81:57] same positions are followed here. Okay,
