[08:44] this course. So let's click on the
[08:45] Jupiter lab launch again. It will take a
[08:49] couple of minutes for this to launch.
[08:51] Remember that the Jupiter lab will
[08:53] launch in the browser window.
[08:56] So I've got my Jupiter lab up and
[08:58] running in the browser window. There is
[09:00] one small warning. Do not close the
[09:03] Anaconda Navigator window as long as you
[09:05] are running the Jupiter lab from here.
[09:08] Okay. So the default installation
[09:11] directory is shown on the left side.
[09:14] This is the file browser window you can
[09:16] see and from here you can actually
[09:18] launch Jupiter notebook. You can have
[09:20] access to the Python console or a
[09:23] terminal. You can also create u uh
[09:26] requirement.txt file from here and you
[09:28] can also create markdown f files with an
[09:31] extension md. You can create standard
[09:33] python files with an extension py and
[09:36] you can also access the other
[09:38] applications from anaconda. Okay. So uh
[09:42] first we will learn how to create a
[09:44] folder within Jupyter lab and then we'll
[09:48] learn how to create a new file a new
[09:51] Jupyter notebook from Anaconda
[09:53] environment and see okay so first you
[09:56] need to decide where you want to keep
[09:58] your code files let's say I want to keep
[10:00] my code files within this is your C and
[10:04] users directory okay from here uh I am
[10:07] just browsing to desktop so just Right
[10:10] click and create a new folder from here.
[10:14] Okay. Specify a folder name.
[10:19] So my folder name is coding essentials
[10:22] for AI. Double click on that. So the
[10:26] folder appears to be empty as of now.
[10:29] And again if you want to create a
[10:30] subfolder you can go ahead and do that.
[10:33] Let's say I create module one. And
[10:36] within module one double click. So to
[10:38] create a new Jupyter notebook, right
[10:40] click and click on the new notebook
[10:43] option. This is the window that will
[10:45] appear. This will ask you to select the
[10:47] Python kernel to associate with the
[10:50] notebook. So you can see that I have no
[10:53] other kernel apart from this basic
[10:55] Python 3. So I'll go ahead and take
