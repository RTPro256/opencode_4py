[92:32] manage the growing code base, we turn to
[92:35] packages. Imagine Redford School decides
[92:37] to expand its system further. They
[92:40] create a student management package with
[92:42] modules for enrollment, attendance, and
[92:45] profile management. They also have
[92:48] packages for teacher management, fee
[92:50] management, and more. Each package
[92:52] represents a logical area of the system
[92:55] and each module inside handles specific
[92:58] tasks related to the area. It's a lot
[93:01] like how a department store is
[93:02] organized. You have different sections
[93:04] for clothing, electronics, and
[93:06] groceries. In Python, a package is
[93:08] essentially a folder containing multiple
[93:10] module files plus an underscore_init_.
[93:16] py file which tells Python that this
[93:20] folder should be treated as a package.
[93:22] Packages can even contain subpackages
[93:24] which are simply folders within folders
[93:27] each with their own init py file. For
[93:31] instance, our school management package
[93:34] could contain subpackages for student
[93:36] management, teacher management, and fee
[93:38] management. This allows us to scale our
[93:41] codebase in an organized and logical way
[93:45] making it easy to find and maintain
[93:47] different parts of our system. So how do
[93:50] we use packages in our main script? It's
[93:52] quite simple. You refer to the package
[93:54] name, subp package name and then the
[93:57] module or function you want to use. For
[93:59] example, if you want to use the
[94:01] enrollment function from the student
[94:03] management package, you might write
[94:05] something like from school management
[94:08] dot student management dot enrollment
[94:11] import enroll student. Thank you for
[94:15] joining me on this journey to understand
[94:16] models and packages in Python. I hope
[94:19] you now appreciate how important these
[94:21] tools are for organizing and managing
[94:24] your code. They help keep your projects
[94:26] clean, efficient, and scalable, making
[94:29] your life as a programmer much easier.
[94:32] Keep practicing. Try creating your own
[94:34] modules and packages, and I'll see you
[94:36] in the next session.
