[366:55] proper format.
[366:57] So I'm again using the markdown function
[367:01] to display it in a markdown format. You
[367:04] can see now it is very well formatted
[367:06] and much easily readable. I have another
[367:09] example here where I am going to share a
[367:11] detailed report on generative AI and I'm
[367:15] going to ask the model to summarize it.
[367:18] Okay. So this is a kind of a prompt
[367:20] template I'm creating. So in that prompt
[367:23] template I'll be attaching this report.
[367:25] This is the entire report which I'll
[367:27] attach along with this prompt template.
[367:29] Okay. So create jamma prompt. There's a
[367:32] complete prompt text and that prompt
[367:34] text is nothing but this entire prompt
[367:36] template which I'll be passing it to the
[367:40] pipeline. So let's see this time. So the
[367:43] maximum tokens is 500. So I expect that
[367:46] the summary is less than or equal to 500
[367:51] tokens. So let me print it. Okay,
[367:55] perfect. So I have exactly got five
[367:57] lines. That is what exactly I had asked.
[368:00] So give me a summary in exactly five
[368:03] lines. So I have got the five line
[368:05] summary of this entire text. Perfect.
[368:07] Let me format it if you want. So this
[368:11] dashes become bullet points here. One
[368:14] last example. We'll take it for a basic
[368:17] sentiment analysis. So here I've got
[368:19] some review and I'll attach that review
[368:22] on this prompt template. So what does
[368:24] this prompt template do? It is asking
[368:26] the model to act as a customer review
[368:29] analyst and asking the model to do two
[368:32] tasks. One is to find the sentiment for
[368:35] this entire review and second to extract
[368:38] five key topics. That entire prompt
[368:40] template is being passed as a prompt
[368:42] now. So this will give me a tokenized
[368:45] prompt and that tokenized prompt is
[368:47] going to the pipeline and finally the
[368:50] output is generated.
[368:54] Fine. So let me display that response.
[368:57] So overall sentiment looks to be
[368:59] positive. Let's read the review. I
[369:01] recently worked with this real estate
[369:03] company and so on. The experience was
[369:06] outstanding, knowledgeable, patient,
[369:09] guided me through every step. Yeah. So
