[237:42] looks very similar to what it is but
[237:45] here if you see the df.info now it is
[237:48] actually present in a datetime format.
[237:50] So you can also extract columns dates
[237:54] months uh week of the year date of the
[237:59] year month of the year quarter
[238:01] information. So you can extract all
[238:03] these information from a datetime
[238:05] column. Now that's it for this video on
[238:07] this extensive coding tutorial on using
[238:10] pandas for data analysis. Today we are
[238:13] going to dive into database and SQL
[238:15] fundamentals. Understanding databases
[238:18] and how to use SQL is an essential skill
[238:21] for anyone working with data especially
[238:23] in the world of AI and machine learning.
[238:25] In this module, we'll learn about
[238:26] databases, their types, the role of SQL,
[238:30] and how these skills fit into AI
[238:32] workflows. Let's get started. In this
[238:35] video, we'll cover several key topics.
[238:37] We'll start by defining what a database
[238:39] is and explore different types of
[238:42] databases. We'll discuss about why
[238:44] databases are essential, especially in
[238:46] the context of AI. Then we'll introduce
[238:50] SQL, the structured query language,
[238:52] which is the standard language for
[238:54] interacting with relational databases.
[238:56] We'll go over basic SQL commands. And
[238:59] finally, we'll see how databases connect
[239:02] to AI agents. A database is essentially
[239:04] an organized collection of data. Think
[239:07] of it as a digital filing system that
[239:10] allows you to store, retrieve, and
[239:12] manage data efficiently. Databases are
[239:15] made up of data, of course, but they
[239:18] also rely on hardware like servers,
[239:21] software, the database management
[239:23] systems, and users who would interact
[239:26] with the data. This organization allows
[239:29] for quick access and manipulation of
[239:32] large amounts of information which is
[239:34] crucial in many applications including
[239:36] AI. Think about all the apps and
[239:39] services you use daily like social
[239:41] media, banking, shopping, etc. All of
[239:44] these services rely on databases to
[239:46] store massive amounts of information
[239:49] about users, transactions, products and
