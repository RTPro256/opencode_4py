[181:37] background has definitely changed. Okay.
[181:40] So back to ggplot. Okay. And you can
[181:44] revert to the default this way. What if
[181:46] you want to save your plot? Then you can
[181:48] use the function called as safe fig.
[181:50] Okay. And provide the figure name. You
[181:53] can provide the depth. DPI is your dots
[181:57] per square in. So 300 dots per square
[181:59] in. By default, it is 72. So if you
[182:02] increase this value, you'll get a much
[182:04] higher resolution image. Of course, that
[182:06] will also take much more space. Okay.
[182:10] The figure size that gets saved will
[182:13] also be much larger in bytes, kilobytes
[182:18] and again box inches that is the tight
[182:21] layout that we are going to create.
[182:23] Okay. So that ensures minimal white
[182:26] space around the figure. Fine. So let's
[182:30] create this plot here. I've created this
[182:32] plot and this is not yet saved. You can
[182:36] see this is not yet saved. But if I want
[182:38] to save this, I'll uncomment this and
[182:40] execute this once again. Okay. And we
[182:43] can verify that this has got saved. So
[182:47] let me just go back and you can see that
[182:50] this was created 11 seconds ago. Okay.
[182:54] So I'm running this on some cloud
[182:57] platform. You can download this
[182:58] otherwise this will be saved in your
[183:00] local drive. If you are running this in
[183:02] Anaconda, this will be saved in your
[183:04] local drive. Okay. So this is the plot
[183:06] which got saved. Perfect. So pretty high
[183:10] resolution. You can see it's not
[183:12] blurring. You can see even if I'm
[183:14] zooming quite a lot, it's not blurring
[183:17] because it's a very high resolution. 300
[183:19] dpi is actually a lot. Okay. So the
[183:22] default is I think 72.
[183:24] Okay. So coming back
[183:27] finally some quick tips. So you can use
[183:29] the subplots for multiple visualizations
[183:31] rather than stacking multiple plots.
[183:33] Okay. One below the other. So you can
[183:35] organize your plots in a grid 2 + 2,
[183:37] grid 3 cross 2, 2 + 3 kind of grids.
[183:40] Okay. Please label your axis properly
[183:42] and put proper labels in the legend for
[183:44] clarity. If you are having multiple
[183:46] plots within the same canvas, use styles
