[241:57] table in the database and define the
[241:59] structure of that table, including its
[242:01] columns and data types. Insert into
[242:04] allows us to add new records or rows to
[242:08] a table. Update lets us modify existing
[242:11] data. Delete allows us to remove data
[242:14] from a table. And this select command is
[242:17] used to retrieve data from the database.
[242:20] It's one of the most commonly used
[242:22] commands. Databases are vital in the
[242:24] field of AI for several reasons. They
[242:26] provide efficient storage solutions for
[242:28] the massive data sets often required for
[242:30] training AI models. Databases makes it
[242:33] easier to access and pre-process data
[242:36] which is crucial step in any AI project.
[242:38] They offer a reliable and consistent
[242:40] source of data ensuring that models are
[242:43] trained on accurate information for AI
[242:45] agents that need realtime data.
[242:48] Databases can provide up-to-date
[242:50] information enabling more dynamic and
[242:53] responsive AI systems. To utilize
[242:55] databases in AI applications, we need to
[242:58] connect them to programming languages
[242:59] like Python. This is done using
[243:01] libraries and tools that allow us to
[243:04] execute SQL queries and manipulate data
[243:07] within our code. Python offers several
[243:09] libraries such as SQLite 3 for SQLite
[243:13] databases, PI MySQL for MySQL and
[243:17] Psychopg2 for Postgrace SQL. OM
[243:21] frameworks like SQL Alchemy can simplify
[243:24] database interactions by allowing us to
[243:26] work with databases as if they were
[243:28] regular Python objects. Once connected,
[243:30] we can extract data, pre-process it, and
[243:33] feed it into AI algorithms for
[243:36] processing and decision making. We have
[243:38] already discussed connecting Python to
[243:40] SQL databases in our previous module.
[243:42] But let's recap briefly. Using Python,
[243:45] we can connect to databases like SQLite
[243:47] and Post SQL using libraries such as
[243:50] SQLite 3, Psychopg2, and SQL Alchemy.
[243:53] The benefit of doing this is that it
[243:55] provides efficient data management
[243:57] allowing Python scripts to read, update
[243:59] and store structured data. This
[244:02] capability is crucial for building
