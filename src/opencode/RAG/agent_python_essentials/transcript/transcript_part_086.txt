[183:50] and colors to create visually appealing
[183:52] plots. Okay? And make sure that your
[183:55] markers are clearly visible. If you have
[183:57] the markers along with the lines, you
[183:59] must have some sort of a contrast
[184:00] between multiple plots and multiple
[184:02] markers present within the same canvas.
[184:04] Okay. So, keep a track of the figures
[184:07] and axis using the interface. That is
[184:09] basically the name numbering of the
[184:12] subplots. Okay. So, we created the
[184:16] subplots here. So, the numbering of the
[184:18] subplots will be decided by this
[184:20] function. Okay. And of course keep
[184:22] checking for the advanced features in
[184:24] the documentation as we have referred
[184:26] for the list of named colors, mattplot
[184:28] lib, line styles, markers and even
[184:31] stylesheets. Okay. So here I have
[184:33] combined few plot types. So here I have
[184:36] got the scatter plot you can see and a
[184:39] line plot. So I have just created some
[184:41] synthetic data. So in one plot I have
[184:43] the scatter values as well as the line
[184:45] chart. And clearly by using the legend
[184:49] in a proper way I am able to demonstrate
[184:51] that this is a line. What does that line
[184:53] represent? It represents a trend you can
[184:56] say. And these are my observed data
[184:58] points. So in your real world scenario
[185:00] these would be your observations. And
[185:02] this line will not be a synthetic line.
[185:04] That would be a line that you get from a
[185:06] regression model. Maybe a linear
[185:08] regression or some some variant of that.
[185:10] And then you have your usual title XL
[185:13] valuable values. Okay. So just a quick
[185:16] conclusion. So we have seen in this
[185:18] notebook how basic plotting and mattplot
[185:21] works. Different types of plot types we
[185:23] have covered as line chart, scatter
[185:26] plots, bar plots, histogram, box plots
[185:28] and even pie charts. Different
[185:29] customizations we did with the labels,
[185:32] legends, styles and markers, colors,
[185:34] marker styles and everything. Multiple
[185:36] plots we have got. How do you save your
[185:39] plots to the hard disk and we have even
[185:42] seen combining multiple plot types in
[185:44] the last example. Okay, so that's it in
