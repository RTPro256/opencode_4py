[141:40] to the^ of 2, e to the^ of 3 e cube and
[141:44] this is the e to the^ of 4. you are
[141:47] using that array as the exponent okay to
[141:50] be raised some basic trigonometric
[141:51] functions sin cos tan so I'm getting the
[141:54] sign by default these are going to
[141:57] compute the numbers or values taking
[142:00] that these angles are in radians
[142:02] remember that okay so sine of 0 radian
[142:05] is 0 sine of by2 radians which is 90°
[142:08] sin 90 is 1 and sine of pi radians
[142:13] essentially is 180° that is again zero
[142:16] Okay. So sine values would be 0 1 and 0.
[142:21] Cos values would be 1 0 1. Okay. And
[142:27] then we have the tan values as well. You
[142:29] can see however some of the numbers are
[142:31] not zeros. That is interesting and that
[142:34] is because of the loss of precision
[142:35] during these floating point
[142:37] calculations. Okay. So this is
[142:39] practically zero. This is also zero.
[142:41] Okay. Okay, any number which is close to
[142:42] 10 ^ of -6 or lower is supposed to be
[142:45] interpreted as zero. Make sure that okay
[142:49] so these this is again infinity and this
[142:52] is again zero. Okay. And similarly we
[142:54] have the hyperbolic functions. Let's see
[142:56] how does the rounding functions work.
[142:58] I'll demonstrate the absolute function
[143:00] the sign fun signum function and the
[143:03] rounding functions like round floor seal
[143:05] and truncate. Okay. So let me create an
[143:08] array again and I want to get the
[143:10] absolute values of these numbers. So
[143:12] this is negative. So in the absolute it
[143:14] will become positive. This is again
[143:16] negative. Absolute will become positive.
[143:18] Yeah. So the absolute values are all
[143:20] positive. You can see and those numbers
[143:23] which had negative sign here they are
[143:25] represented by minus1. All the positive
[143:28] numbers are represented by + one. Now I
[143:30] want to do the rounding. So rounding
[143:34] function works
[143:36] by rounding these numbers to their
[143:38] nearest decimal place nearest integer
[143:42] let's say. So the nearest integer to
[143:44] this would be minus2. The nearest
[143:46] integer to this would be zero. The
[143:49] nearest integer to this would be 1.
