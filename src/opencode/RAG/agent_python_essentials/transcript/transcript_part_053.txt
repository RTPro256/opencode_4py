[113:53] providing the nd array object for
[113:56] efficient array operations and a vast
[113:59] range of numerical functions. In this
[114:01] video, we'll explore how it works, why
[114:03] is it essential for data science, and
[114:06] key features such as universal
[114:08] functions, random sampling, and linear
[114:10] algebra routines. Numpy stands for
[114:12] numerical Python, and it's built around
[114:15] the ND array, the N dimensional array
[114:19] object data structure. So unlike pure
[114:21] Python list, ND array objects are much
[114:26] more efficient and support vectorzed
[114:28] operations, meaning that you can apply
[114:31] the operations on the entire array
[114:34] without writing a single loop. And this
[114:36] makes your code run faster and keeps it
[114:39] easier to read and maintain. Plus
[114:42] because numpy is so fundamental other
[114:44] popular data science libraries like
[114:46] pandas for tablet data or sci for
[114:49] scientific computing and even
[114:51] scikitlearn which is used for machine
[114:52] learning they heavily use numpy objects
[114:56] under the hood. Numpai's universal
[114:58] functions or u funks perform the
[115:02] elementwise operations across arrays.
[115:05] For basic arithmetic for example
[115:08] addition, subtraction, multiplication
[115:10] and division. It is very
[115:11] straightforward. We call either the
[115:13] np.add function or simply write a + b.
[115:17] We also have exponential and logarithmic
[115:19] functions that operate element
[115:21] byelement. Now this level of
[115:23] vectorization is fast and makes our code
[115:26] concise and also readable. If you're
[115:28] dealing with any kind of scientific or
[115:30] engineering data or trigonometric
[115:32] functions are likely to come up. Numpai
[115:34] offers a full suite of trigonometric
[115:37] functions like s cosine tangent and so
[115:40] on and their inverse counterparts all of
[115:43] which work element wise. Now same goes
[115:45] for the hyperbolic functions as well. So
[115:48] whether you are modeling waves or
[115:50] working on signal processing or even
[115:52] analyzing periodic data, NumPy has got
[115:55] you covered. Sometimes you need to clean
[115:57] up your data by rounding values. Maybe
