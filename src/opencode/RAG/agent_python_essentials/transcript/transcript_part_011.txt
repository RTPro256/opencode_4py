[22:05] the first one which is implementing
[22:08] variables and data types in Python. So
[22:11] let's get started.
[22:14] Okay. So you can execute all the codes
[22:17] uh by using or by clicking on this
[22:20] button which is the run button. Okay. or
[22:23] a keyboard shortcut you can use that is
[22:26] shift enter or control enter. So I'll
[22:28] use this keyboard shortcut key uh shift
[22:31] enter.
[22:32] So let me define a variable name a and
[22:35] assign a value equal to five.
[22:38] So how do I know that the value has been
[22:40] assigned? Let's print the value of the
[22:42] variable. So when I executed this cell
[22:45] by using shift enter this is the value
[22:47] of five that I have got for this a. So
[22:50] this way you can define any variable
[22:53] name and using the equality operator you
[22:56] can assign a value to it. Okay. You can
[22:59] also use the print function to print the
[23:02] value of the variable. You can see that
[23:05] print a gives me five. Fine. So here I
[23:09] am defining a equal to 7 and I am
[23:12] creating another variable b and
[23:14] assigning the value back to a and then
[23:17] changing the value of a from 7 to 3.
[23:20] Let's see what happens. So what will be
[23:22] the value of a now? Since the value of a
[23:24] has been changed from a equal to 7 to a=
[23:27] 3, this should give me a equal to 3.
[23:30] Perfect. And since B was assigned a
[23:33] value equal to A when A was having a
[23:36] value of seven, B should still point to
[23:39] the original value of A which is seven.
[23:42] Super. So this is how the variables work
[23:46] in Python. Now we have already discussed
[23:49] the variable name rules in the
[23:54] presentation. So here is a quick recap
[23:56] of those rules. Python variable names
[24:00] are case sensitive which means small A
[24:01] and capital A would be different. Um
[24:05] identifiers or variable names can be a
[24:07] combination of letters, lower case or
[24:09] upper case and digits. You can even use
[24:11] underscore. You can use the underscore
[24:13] at the start or at the end. So these are
[24:16] all valid variable names. You cannot use
[24:20] a variable name which starts with a
[24:22] digit.
