[15:15] saved, you can go to file and locate in
[15:20] drive. So this will go to the exact
[15:24] collab notebooks folder in your Google
[15:28] account.
[15:30] So now as you can see all my collab
[15:33] notebooks are located in the my drive
[15:36] collab notebooks folder. Okay. So this
[15:38] is the module one Jupyter notebook which
[15:41] I created on uh collab and there are
[15:45] some other notebooks which I had already
[15:47] created. So this is present within my
[15:49] drive collab notebooks. So this is how
[15:51] you can actually also upload your collab
[15:54] notebooks to this particular drive and
[15:56] execute it from there. So let's say if
[15:58] you want to execute it from here, you
[16:00] can open any of the existing notebooks
[16:03] by right-clicking on it and open with
[16:06] Google Collab. This is how you can open
[16:09] any Jupyter notebook. Once you have
[16:11] uploaded it on Google Collab, right
[16:13] click and open it on Google Collab. So
[16:16] this will open it in another tab from
[16:19] where you can again connect to a runtime
[16:21] and start executing. So that's it for
[16:24] this particular video. See you in the
[16:26] next one. Thank you.
[16:28] Hello and welcome back. In this video,
[16:30] we'll dive into some foundational
[16:32] concepts that are essential for coding
[16:34] in Python. The variables, data types,
[16:37] and operators.
[16:38] By the end of this session, you will
[16:40] understand how to declare variables, use
[16:43] different types of data, and perform
[16:45] operations on them. So, let's get
[16:48] started. Let's get started with the
[16:50] variables and data types. First, let's
[16:53] talk about variables and data types in
[16:55] Python. Think of variables as a
[16:57] container that stores information like a
[17:00] number, a word, or even a list of items.
[17:03] Python makes working with variables very
[17:06] easy. You don't need to declare them
[17:08] explicitly unlike some other programming
[17:11] languages. Just give them a name and
[17:13] assign them a value and voila, you are
[17:16] ready to use them. For instance, here we
[17:19] see different data types like numbers,
[17:21] strings, and even more complex data
