[318:46] rendered. Okay. So this form uh action
[318:49] is sub uh here you'll you are creating a
[318:52] text field and then a submit button a
[318:55] simple form with a text field here and a
[318:57] submit button. Okay. So once the button
[319:00] is submitted then the request.post
[319:03] method gets accepted. Okay. And in this
[319:06] case uh this is what is returned. Okay.
[319:09] So the same message is returned along
[319:11] with this string. So let's display this
[319:13] form. Okay. Again I have to stop the
[319:16] previous. Okay, now it's serving. So I
[319:20] can access this form here.
[319:25] So you can see on the top left I've got
[319:27] a small form and uh uh let me provide
[319:31] some message here. So hello world this
[319:35] is flask app
[319:38] and hit submit. So this is what you
[319:41] submitted to the server right. Perfect.
[319:44] So this works and you can also access
[319:47] via this curl. Okay. So I'm just
[319:50] stopping it. Now what if you want to
[319:52] access the same post this form basically
[319:55] you want to access it via Python code.
[319:58] Okay. You want to submit a post request
[320:01] to the server using a Python code. Okay.
[320:04] You don't want to fill this form.
[320:06] Essentially you don't want to fill this
[320:07] form. Okay. You refresh this and it will
[320:10] again give you the form. So let's say uh
[320:12] you don't want to fill this form. So
[320:14] then this is the code that you will
[320:16] need. Okay. So what I'm going to do is
[320:18] copy this code. Run this flask cap.
[320:21] Okay. Run this flask cap. You cannot run
[320:23] this code in the same notebook because
[320:26] you cannot run multiple codes in the
[320:28] same notebook. So I'm going to create a
[320:30] temporary notebook here where I'll paste
[320:33] that code just to run it. Okay. So this
[320:36] code is going to access your flask app
[320:40] with the post method. So this is the URL
[320:42] where I'm going to place the request.
[320:44] Okay. So this is the URL and this is the
[320:47] message which I was supposed to type in
[320:50] the front end. Right? So this is let me
[320:52] just refresh. Okay. So yeah here. So
[320:56] whatever you want to type here you just
[320:58] want to submit that from the back end
[321:00] here. Okay. So the same message you are
