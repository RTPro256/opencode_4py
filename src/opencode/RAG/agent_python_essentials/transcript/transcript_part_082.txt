[175:05] and 2 pi and the labels are also in the
[175:08] mathematical notations that you have
[175:10] given here. Fine. So you can also
[175:13] provide labels in this format. Let me
[175:16] just copy this. Okay. If you want your
[175:19] labels to have a scientific notation,
[175:22] you can also do this. So you can use a
[175:24] dollar sign $2 and then back slash write
[175:28] pi and this would be same dollar sign
[175:33] back slash 2 pi. Okay. Oh sorry I missed
[175:38] the dollar sign closure. Okay that was
[175:41] the error. Okay you can see don't forget
[175:43] to close this dollar sign. So dollar
[175:46] sign start and close again dollar sign
[175:48] start and close and within that you can
[175:50] provide the mathematical symbols. Okay.
[175:53] So here I have provided the mathematical
[175:54] symbol pi. So that is another way you
[175:57] can actually do this. So you can see pi
[176:00] written in mathematical notation. Okay.
[176:02] You can provide any other mathematical
[176:04] notation there. So if you want to go
[176:06] with sigma, let's see how that sigma
[176:09] appears and so on. You can go with
[176:11] alpha, beta, gamma, delta. All sort of
[176:13] mathematical symbols you can have in the
[176:16] labels. That's exactly how. Okay. Now
[176:20] let's see how we can work with multiple
[176:22] plots that is by creating multiple
[176:24] plots, multiple axes and even subplots.
[176:27] Okay. So here I'm using the subplots
[176:29] function from the PLT module. How many
[176:32] rows? I have one row and two columns. So
[176:34] it will come as side by side two plots.
[176:37] The total size of the figure canvas is
[176:39] 10 + 4. Okay. And in the first subplots,
[176:43] so these are the index for the subplots.
[176:45] So zero means the index for the first
[176:46] subplot. And then this is the usual
[176:48] plot. and then the title for that
[176:50] particular subplot. Okay. Now this time
[176:52] the function changes from plt.title to
[176:56] axis0 that is the index for that
[176:58] particular subplot and this will become
[177:00] set title function that is the object-
[177:02] oriented programming concept that we are
[177:04] applying here. Same goes for the second
[177:06] subplot. So first you reference to the
[177:08] second subplot axis and then the usual
[177:11] plotting functions and then same goes
