[323:18] will come in a JSON format. So this part
[323:20] of the code is same. Okay. Let me run
[323:21] this and again to access this I'm going
[323:24] to copy this code. So if you are
[323:26] accessing this from the front end, it
[323:28] will not be much different from here.
[323:30] Let's see. Okay. So the JSON data that
[323:33] I'm going to parse here is message. So
[323:36] this this is important because this
[323:38] field will be uh searched by the server.
[323:41] Okay. To process your request. Okay. So
[323:43] this is the URL which you are hitting
[323:45] and this JSON data is parsed to the JSON
[323:49] argument here. And now from the
[323:51] response.json JSON you are able to fetch
[323:54] your entire output. So response.json is
[323:57] what you are interested in right
[323:59] perfect. So let me stop this and finally
[324:02] we are going to create a almost end
[324:04] toend application with a front end and a
[324:06] back end kind of. Okay. It's a pretty
[324:08] advanced app with HTML templating and uh
[324:11] supported by Ginga library and CSS
[324:14] rendering. Okay. So can be a bit tricky
[324:17] for a beginner to understand this entire
[324:19] codebase. I would strongly suggest you
[324:21] to copy this, paste it in Chad JPD and
[324:24] ask Chad JPD to explain you line by line
[324:26] that will be very easy. I'm assuming
[324:28] that you are fairly comfortable with
[324:30] Python coding and for that reason I'll
[324:32] just explain in high level what is
[324:34] happening. So this is very much the same
[324:38] code which I used here. So which I had
[324:41] used for the get method. Okay, just
[324:43] converted that into a post method now.
[324:46] Okay, just converted that into a post.
[324:48] So the first difference is here I have
[324:50] added a home route base route. Okay. So
[324:55] which you can access. This is important.
[324:57] Okay. Earlier we had not done that. So
[324:59] this is a root route. So where this HTML
[325:03] page will be rendered. So there are
[325:05] three HTML pages which will be used in
[325:07] this Flask app. So one is the homepage.
[325:10] Second is the form page. So this is this
[325:14] form uh that we were you know creating
[325:18] this form on the fly using a Python
[325:20] code. Instead of creating this form on
[325:22] the fly, I have already created this
