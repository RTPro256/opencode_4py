[42:22] files or you can also start your
[42:26] comments from the start of a line as
[42:28] well. Okay. So when I execute this block
[42:30] of code, this line is executed. This
[42:35] line is commented. Okay. So let me
[42:37] uncomment that. So I deleted this
[42:40] hashtag. And let me re-execute. So when
[42:43] I executed it again, you can see I get
[42:46] the print statement from here as well as
[42:48] this one. This was earlier commented. So
[42:51] this second line was not appearing in
[42:54] the output. Okay. Now I can repeat it.
[42:57] So I am commenting the first line and
[43:00] executing this block of code once again.
[43:03] You can see that since the first line
[43:04] got commented, this is not executed and
[43:07] only this line got executed. Okay.
[43:11] So this way you can write down multiple
[43:13] lines of code within a code block and
[43:15] select which line you want to comment
[43:17] and uncomment. So the keyboard shortcuts
[43:20] for commenting and uncommenting is you
[43:22] can in Windows system you can click on
[43:26] control ctrl and this backslash. Okay.
[43:31] So whichever place your cursor in
[43:33] whichever line you want to comment or
[43:35] uncomment. Okay. And just press control
[43:38] and slash this will be commented. And
[43:41] again if you do the same control and
[43:43] slash it will be uncommented.
[43:46] Okay. Now let's check some conditional
[43:48] statements. Okay, we have already seen.
[43:52] So here I'm going for the if statement.
[43:54] I'm assigning a value of 1 to x and
[43:56] checking if x is equal to 1. Let's see.
[43:59] Yes, indeed x is equal to 1. So it
[44:02] entered within the if condition and this
[44:05] print statement was executed. Now here
[44:08] since already x is equal to 1, I'm
[44:10] checking whether x is equal to three. So
[44:14] you now know that this will return
[44:15] false. Since it is returning false, this
[44:18] print statement will not execute. So
[44:21] nothing happens here. So now I'm having
[44:24] a equal to 5 and b equal to 10. I'm
[44:26] checking whether a is greater than b. So
[44:28] is 5 greater than 10? No. So it goes to
[44:32] the else. Okay? Because this is false.
[44:35] So this statement is not executed. So
[44:37] the condition automatically goes to
