[292:37] in place to prevent abuse. Exceeding
[292:40] these limits can get your access
[292:42] temporarily or even permanently blocked.
[292:45] Secure your API keys. API keys are
[292:47] sensitive information. Store them
[292:49] securely. Use environment variables or a
[292:52] secure storage mechanism. Validate
[292:54] inputs and outputs. Ensure all your
[292:58] inputs and outputs are properly
[293:00] validated to maintain data integrity and
[293:04] prevent security vulnerabilities. And
[293:06] finally, use logging. Keep a log of API
[293:09] requests and responses. This helps in
[293:11] debugging issues and understanding what
[293:14] went wrong during interactions.
[293:16] Following these best practices will make
[293:18] your API integration much more reliable
[293:21] and secure. Error handling in API
[293:24] requests. Error handling is a critical
[293:26] part of interacting with APIs. Here are
[293:29] some of the common HTTP status codes and
[293:32] what they mean. 400 bad request. The
[293:35] request was invalid possibly due to
[293:38] incorrect syntax. 401 unauthorized
[293:41] authentication is needed to access this
[293:44] resource. 403 forbidden means the server
[293:48] understood the request but is refusing
[293:50] to authorize it. 404
[293:53] not found error. This means the resource
[293:55] you are trying to access doesn't exist.
[293:58] 500 internal server error. This means
[294:01] that something went wrong on the server
[294:03] side itself. The best practices for
[294:05] handling errors include number one,
[294:07] always check the status code. This helps
[294:10] you understand whether the request was
[294:12] successful or if there's an issue. Use
[294:15] raise for status method to raise
[294:18] exceptions for error codes automatically
[294:21] which ensures that errors are handled in
[294:23] your Python script. Proper error
[294:25] handling makes your application more
[294:27] robust, ensuring that even if something
[294:30] goes wrong, your users experience
[294:33] minimal disruption. API rate limiting.
[294:36] Now, let's talk about API rate limiting.
[294:38] Rate limiting involves restricting the
[294:40] number of requests a client can make to
[294:43] an API in a given period. The purpose of
[294:46] rate limiting is to prevent abuse and
