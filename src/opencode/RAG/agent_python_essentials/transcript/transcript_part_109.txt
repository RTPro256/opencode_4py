[235:31] lambda function being applied on a
[235:33] single column, right? We have already
[235:35] updated that. So, these are the marks.
[235:40] So, let me decrease the marks by 10 to
[235:43] get the original marks because I have
[235:45] already added it two times. So I've
[235:49] decreased the marks by 10 to get the
[235:51] original marks. Now uh here I've written
[235:54] a custom function which I'm going to
[235:56] apply. Here I have applied a simple
[235:58] lambda function. But instead of applying
[236:01] a simple lambda function, you can also
[236:02] apply a custom function. So what does
[236:05] this do? So I'm going to assign the
[236:07] grades based on the marks. So if the
[236:09] marks is greater than 85 then I'm going
[236:12] to return a grade. If the marks is
[236:14] between 70 and 85 it is going to be b
[236:16] grade. And if the marks is less than 70
[236:19] it will be C grade. Okay. So after
[236:22] applying the function on this column I'm
[236:25] creating another column called as grade.
[236:28] So I've got the grades of the students
[236:30] as well. Now you can also map um values
[236:35] of a particular column to some other
[236:37] value. So let's say in this case I'm
[236:40] mapping males to zero and females to
[236:42] one. This can be done for uh label
[236:45] encoding typically used in machine
[236:47] learning. So I've created a new column
[236:49] called as gender new in which zeros
[236:52] represent males and ones represent
[236:55] females. So how was this done? By simple
[236:59] mapper. So your mapper is a dictionary
[237:02] where the original value becomes the key
[237:04] and the new value becomes the value. So
[237:06] you can also use pandas to handle dates
[237:08] and times. Let's see here. Here I've
[237:11] created a simple data frame uh with some
[237:13] names and dates. You can see these dates
[237:16] are actually strings. How do I know?
[237:18] Because of the data type present in the
[237:20] info. So the info gives me a object data
[237:23] type. So I can convert those strings
[237:27] into actual datetime objects by using
[237:30] the datetime function. So I'm converting
[237:32] the strings into a datetime. That's what
[237:35] the two datetime function does. And
[237:37] replacing the original column. So after
[237:39] doing that you can see visually it still
