[195:00] a single column you don't have to go for
[195:03] a list. But if you're but if you want to
[195:05] pull out multiple columns from the data
[195:08] frame, you need to pass it as a list of
[195:10] column names. Now let's say you want to
[195:12] only display those rows. This is your
[195:15] complete data frame. Now you want to
[195:17] display only those rows. Okay, where the
[195:20] marks is greater than 80. So essentially
[195:23] if you want to manually check where the
[195:25] marks is greater than 80. So this is
[195:29] greater than 80. This is greater than
[195:30] 80. This one. Okay. So you should be
[195:34] getting only three rows. Let's verify.
[195:36] So yeah, these are the three students
[195:38] who have secured marks greater than 80.
[195:42] So this is how you can select rows based
[195:45] on some column names. Okay. Or based on
[195:49] some conditions applied on the columns.
[195:52] How do we select some rows? So to select
[195:55] rows, you need to use the function lock
[195:58] and I lock. Okay, let's see. So but
[196:01] before we understand the concept of lock
[196:03] and eyelock let's understand labels. So
[196:07] in a data frame these are my column
[196:10] labels. These are my column labels and
[196:13] these are my row labels.
[196:16] So what you see in bold they are labels.
[196:19] Also the data frame columns and rows
[196:23] have indices by default. So the default
[196:26] index starts from zero. So this is zero.
[196:28] This is 1 2 3 and four. So the index of
[196:33] subject is four. Index of age column is
[196:36] two. Index of name column is zero.
[196:38] Similarly these are my indices. Okay. So
[196:42] by default the row labels and row
[196:46] indices are same. These are my indices.
[196:49] These are index. Remember that the one
[196:51] in blue are index. Row index and column
[196:54] index. Okay. So you can use the lock
[196:57] method and fetch rows by providing
[197:02] labels. You can use the eyelock method
[197:05] and provide index and fetch the rows. So
[197:09] you can fetch rows by using their labels
[197:12] or by using their indices. Okay. If you
[197:15] want to provide the labels of the rows,
[197:18] you should use the lock method. If you
[197:20] want to use index of the rows, use the
[197:23] eyelock method. So is essentially index
[197:28] based locations. So let's see the
