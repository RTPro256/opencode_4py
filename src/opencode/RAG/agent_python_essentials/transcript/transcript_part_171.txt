[373:31] It's like having an AI assistant that
[373:33] understands code and can make
[373:36] suggestions. Next up is Langraph.
[373:38] Another tool that's a bit different from
[373:40] lang chain. Lang graph is all about
[373:43] workflow management. Lets you design
[373:46] workflows using something called as
[373:48] directed as cyclic graphs or dags where
[373:52] each part of the workflow is represented
[373:54] by a node. What's really cool about
[373:56] langraph is its advanced memory
[373:59] capabilities. Not only can it remember
[374:01] important details, but it's also capable
[374:04] of handling errors and even allowing
[374:07] human intervention if needed. This makes
[374:10] it robust and ideal for more complex
[374:12] projects. Another unique feature is that
[374:14] Langraph integrates seamlessly with
[374:17] Langchain. So you get best of both
[374:20] worlds that is Langchain's resources and
[374:22] Langraph's workflow structure. Lastly,
[374:25] Langraph has caching. So you can save
[374:28] the progress of a workflow and return to
[374:30] it later, which is incredibly useful for
[374:34] complex applications. So where would you
[374:37] use Langraph? It's perfect for managing
[374:39] complex workflows with multiple steps
[374:42] that need to interact with each other.
[374:44] Imagine a data processing pipeline where
[374:47] one step relies on the output of the
[374:49] other. Langraph can handle all that
[374:51] while keeping everything organized.
[374:53] Agentic rags combine generative models
[374:56] with reasoning capabilities allowing
[374:58] agents to autonomously generate
[375:00] responses based on both learned
[375:02] knowledge and logical inference. So in
[375:04] multi- aent systems multiple such agents
[375:07] collaborate or compete sharing
[375:10] information coordinating actions and
[375:12] solving complex task through collective
[375:15] reasoning and communication enhancing
[375:18] scalability and adaptability in dynamic
[375:21] environments. All this can be very
[375:23] easily and efficiently handled by
[375:26] langraph. Moving on to crew AI. Crew AI
[375:29] has a unique approach by organizing AI
[375:32] agents around specific roles. This means
[375:36] each agent is assigned to a particular
[375:38] role or function making it easy to
