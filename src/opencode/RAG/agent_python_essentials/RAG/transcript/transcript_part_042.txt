[90:26] is py. To create a module, all you need
[90:28] to do is create a new Python file. For
[90:31] example, my_module
[90:34] py. Write your Python code in this file
[90:37] and then save it. It's ready to use.
[90:40] Modules are like drawers in a cabinet.
[90:42] They help keep related items grouped
[90:45] together, making it easier to find and
[90:48] reuse them when you need them. Imagine
[90:51] Redford School has been tasked with
[90:53] developing a school management system.
[90:56] This system needs to handle student
[90:58] management, teacher management, fee
[91:01] calculation and grading. Initially, they
[91:03] might put everything into a single file.
[91:06] Let's call it as school management. py.
[91:09] But as the number of features grows,
[91:11] this single file becomes huge and
[91:13] unmanageable. It becomes hard to find
[91:15] specific pieces of code. And making
[91:18] changes without breaking something else
[91:20] is a nightmare. This is where modules
[91:22] come in. Now, instead of one big file,
[91:25] Redford School decides to break down the
[91:27] school management system into smaller
[91:29] logical modules. Student management. py
[91:33] for student related functions.
[91:35] Teacher_management.
[91:37] py for teacher related functions, fee
[91:40] calculation. py for handling all fee
[91:43] related tasks, grading system. py for
[91:46] managing grades. This way the code is
[91:49] modular, easier to manage and much less
[91:52] errorprone. If you need to make a change
[91:54] to the grading system, you can just open
[91:56] the grading system. py without worrying
[91:59] about the student or teacher management
[92:01] code. Now let's see how to use these
[92:03] modules. All the different modules for
[92:05] student, teacher, fee and grading can be
[92:07] pulled together in a main script py. The
[92:10] script coordinates between all the
[92:13] modules making it the control center of
[92:16] the application. Now imagine if the
[92:18] school notices that the management
[92:20] system keeps growing, they can further
[92:22] modularize by breaking functionalities
[92:24] into more modules. This flexibility
[92:27] helps keep code organized as the project
[92:30] evolves. When modules are not enough to
