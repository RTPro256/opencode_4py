[12:53] contents some standard uh collab
[12:56] notebooks would be there. So what I'll
[12:58] do is click on file new notebook in
[13:03] drive. This will create a new Jupiter
[13:06] notebook and that will be saved in your
[13:09] Google drive.
[13:13] Okay. So on the top you can double click
[13:17] and provide a name to your Jupyter
[13:20] notebook. Your Jupyter notebook will
[13:22] have the extension IP NB that is
[13:25] interactive Python notebook as the
[13:27] default extension.
[13:30] And again as usual this is your code
[13:33] block. Okay, you can type your Python
[13:36] code. So let's say this is my first
[13:39] hello world program in Python. And again
[13:42] you have three options to execute. But
[13:44] before that on the top right
[13:48] make sure that you have connected your
[13:52] Jupyter notebook with a remote Python
[13:55] kernel which will be running on Google's
[13:58] server. Okay. So you have many options
[14:02] but we'll go with the default option
[14:04] right now. Click on the connect to a new
[14:07] runtime. So make sure that your Jupiter
[14:10] notebook is connected to a runtime. Once
[14:13] it is connected, it will show a tick
[14:14] mark. This might take 15 to 20 seconds
[14:18] for it to connect. Uh please note that
[14:20] in the free account of Google Collab,
[14:24] you cannot run parallelly more than one
[14:27] collab notebooks. If you try to run
[14:29] another collab notebook, it will ask you
[14:32] to shut down the previous notebook. So
[14:34] this is one limitation with the free
[14:36] account for Google Collab. So as you can
[14:39] see uh there is a green tick which means
[14:41] my collab notebook has already been
[14:43] connected to the remote runtime. So now
[14:46] I can go back to my code and again I can
[14:49] execute this. So again execution has
[14:51] three options. You can click on this
[14:54] icon to execute the cell or you can do a
[14:57] control enter or a shift enter. So I'll
[15:00] click on this link and uh you can see
[15:03] the output of this cell is below the
[15:06] cell. Okay. So this is how you can
[15:09] quickly create your codes in uh collab
[15:12] notebook environment. And if you're
[15:14] curious to know where is this notebook
