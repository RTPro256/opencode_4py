[298:57] Flask provides the essential components
[298:59] to build web applications and APIs such
[299:02] as routing, request handling, and a
[299:05] development server. Its simplicity and
[299:08] flexibility makes it a popular choice
[299:11] for developers who want more control
[299:13] over their applications. Let's break
[299:16] down the process of creating endpoints
[299:18] with Flask. First, you need to import
[299:20] Flask and create an instance of the
[299:22] Flask application. This is typically
[299:25] done with app equal to flask
[299:28] named_.
[299:30] Second step in flask we use decorators
[299:34] to define routes. A decorator is a
[299:37] special Python syntax that starts with
[299:39] add the rate symbol. It's a way to
[299:42] modify or enhance the Python functions.
[299:46] The routes are the URLs of your API. For
[299:49] example, /hello or slash users. The HTTP
[299:54] methods like get and post define what
[299:56] kind of operation we are performing. Get
[300:00] is usually for retrieving data while
[300:03] post is for sending data to be
[300:05] processed. Finally, we can run the app
[300:07] by using the command python app.py as
[300:11] you see here in the terminal or the
[300:13] command prompt. The endpoint we created
[300:15] can be accessed from the browser window
[300:17] as shown here. Now let's see the process
[300:20] of creating endpoints which uses the get
[300:22] method for user requests. The first step
[300:25] we will import the modules request for
[300:28] accessing the request data and JSON for
[300:31] JSON responses. So then we would define
[300:34] the routes by using the methods
[300:37] parameter to specify the HTTP methods.
[300:40] As you can see in the line number six we
[300:42] are defining the route and methods equal
[300:45] to get. Then in the line number eight,
[300:48] we are accessing the data. You can also
[300:51] do this by request.get JSON in case the
[300:55] payload comes as a JSON format. And
[300:57] finally, we are going to return the
[300:59] response by using the JSON function in
[301:02] the JSON format if you want. Once you
[301:05] are done with the app creation, you can
[301:07] run the app and we can access the app
[301:10] from the browser window. We have to go
[301:12] to the local host which can be accessed
