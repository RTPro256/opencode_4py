[224:18] two missing values and the other two
[224:20] columns don't have any missing value.
[224:22] Right? So column- wise how many missing
[224:24] values are present you can use this code
[224:26] to get. So now you want to fill the
[224:30] missing values with the average value of
[224:33] that column. Let's say uh right now the
[224:35] missing value is present in the age
[224:38] column. So you can take the average age
[224:41] and fill the missing values. So fill na
[224:43] function fill the nan values that's what
[224:46] this function does filling the nan
[224:48] values okay fill na is fill the nan
[224:51] values in that column so again by
[224:54] default that is false so you'll have to
[224:56] make it true so that the filling happens
[224:58] permanently or replace the original
[225:01] column either way so after filling
[225:04] replace the original column that is one
[225:05] way or you use the in place option so
[225:08] now you can see this 23.5 and this 23.5
[225:12] 5 is coming because of the fill na
[225:15] function. Earlier these were nans. So
[225:17] you can check the info and if you want
[225:19] you can convert it back into a integer
[225:21] format. So you will lose some precision.
[225:23] So these decimal points will be ignored
[225:25] then. Okay. Or rounded to the nearest
[225:28] whole number. So I have type casted it
[225:30] back to a integer. So it depends on your
[225:32] use case. You might want to do that. So
[225:35] here the function used is as type. as
[225:38] type changes the data type of a column
[225:40] to a specified data type. So I am type
[225:43] casting it back to a integer. So you can
[225:45] type cast it to a integer 8 bit 16 bit
[225:48] or a 32-bit precision. So based on your
[225:51] use case okay so I'm creating a few more
[225:55] missing values after creating a copy of
[225:58] the data frame. So I'm creating a copy
[226:00] and from that copy I'm dropping some
[226:03] more uh values. So creating some more
[226:06] missing values in the updated marks.
[226:08] This time you can see this is one, this
[226:10] is one. Uh other thing that you can do
[226:14] is instead of filling the missing
[226:16] values, you might want to drop the rows
[226:19] which have missing values. So let's say
[226:20] I want to drop these two rows which have
[226:23] the missing values. So that can be done
