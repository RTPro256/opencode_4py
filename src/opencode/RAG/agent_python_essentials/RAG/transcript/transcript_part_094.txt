[202:06] provide access it will take access equal
[202:10] to zero in that case it will start
[202:13] dropping the rows in place is basically
[202:17] you want to drop the rows or columns
[202:20] permanently that means in place equal to
[202:22] true. So you can make it false if you
[202:25] want to see whether you are dropping the
[202:27] right row or the right column or not.
[202:30] Anyway the in place option is by default
[202:32] false. So you will have to explicitly
[202:34] set it to true otherwise it will not be
[202:37] dropped permanently. It will be dropped
[202:39] from the view but not from the actual
[202:42] data frame. Okay. So make sure that if
[202:44] you want to drop it permanently you make
[202:47] it in place equal to true. Now let's see
[202:50] how can we index some particular values.
[202:53] So right now if you see I want to fetch
[202:56] the values present in the name column
[202:59] and uh the first index. Okay. So this
[203:02] will give me the entire name column and
[203:05] now I am fetching the index zero. So
[203:07] that index zero gives me RF patail.
[203:11] That's exactly what I got here. So you
[203:13] can also slice our data frames. So this
[203:16] is getting the first two rows. You can
[203:18] actually use the iO method as I taught
[203:21] before or you can directly give the
[203:25] index of the row labels. You can reset
[203:29] your index also. Okay. So suppose uh
[203:32] your original data frame has the index
[203:35] as 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. These are your
[203:39] index. How do you know that these are
[203:41] the index? Uh you can check df do.index.
[203:45] So your index starts with zero ends at
[203:48] 8. So 0 to 8 in fact it will end at
[203:51] seven with a step size of one. And if
[203:53] you want to know what all columns are
[203:55] present column names so df doc columns.
[203:57] So these are the column names present in
[203:59] your data set. Okay. So these are the
[204:02] column names and these are the row names
[204:04] basically labels. So you want to set a
[204:07] new name to the row labels. So what I
[204:11] want is this name should it so what I
[204:14] want is this named column itself to be
[204:17] set as the new index. I want to set this
[204:20] as a new index. So that is exactly what
[204:23] we are going to do by this code. So now
[204:26] you can see the names of this DF. Yeah.
