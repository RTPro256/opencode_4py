[350:29] genetic VI is a technology that can so
[350:32] and so. So this is the summarized
[350:33] version of this entire text. Okay. And
[350:36] if you want you can count this should
[350:38] not be more than five lines. Similarly
[350:40] for the Gemma model the only difference
[350:42] is the Gemma tob it API URL is being
[350:45] used instead of the Mistl model. Let's
[350:47] see the response here. I've got only a
[350:50] single line response in this case. Okay.
[350:53] Not expected. This was supposed to be
[350:55] five lines at least like this.
[350:58] Anyway, let's take another example. I've
[351:00] got a review here uh about
[351:04] So here the review says, I recently
[351:06] worked with real estate company to
[351:08] purchase my first home and the
[351:10] experience was outstanding. So the agent
[351:13] was knowledgeable, patient, incredibly
[351:15] responsive and so on. They guided me
[351:17] through every step of the process
[351:19] picking what could have been a stressful
[351:21] experience. So basically this is a
[351:24] review about a real estate company.
[351:27] Fine. So act as a customer review
[351:30] analyst and given the following customer
[351:33] review text do the following tasks. So
[351:35] first you'll have to first I'm asking
[351:38] the model to find the sentiment either
[351:41] positive, negative or neutral. And then
[351:43] I'm asking the model to extract five key
[351:45] topics or phrases from this review.
[351:49] Okay. and then passing that entire
[351:52] review text as a placeholder just the
[351:54] way we did in the above case again using
[351:58] the same query function this time I'm
[352:00] using the Mistl model first let me fetch
[352:03] the response from the Mistl model and
[352:05] see okay so the overall sentiment uh the
[352:08] model has figured out to be positive and
[352:11] these are five key topics or phrases
[352:13] this review is talking about so
[352:15] outstanding experience knowledgeable
[352:17] agent patient smooth and enjoyable
[352:19] process process and guidance through
[352:21] every step. Super. Let's see what the
[352:24] Gemma model says. Again, the only
[352:27] downside was the high price of the
[352:29] property. Uh the overall I would rate my
[352:32] experience with this four out of five
