[213:07] do merge operation. So this is my data
[213:11] frame on the left side, data frame on
[213:12] the right side. On on will use a key. On
[213:17] will use a key. So you can specify the
[213:22] column which is to be used as a key. So
[213:26] this is the key. How? So if you are
[213:29] familiar with SQL, you might be already
[213:32] knowing inner join, outer join, left
[213:35] join and right join. If you're not
[213:38] familiar, uh you can go ahead and read
[213:40] about these kind of joins um on our
[213:43] website analyticsia.com.
[213:45] the lot of blocks which explain the
[213:47] concept of SQL joins. Okay. So here I'm
[213:50] using the inner join which will match
[213:52] the keys in both the data frames. So
[213:56] here the keys are AB. Here the keys are
[213:59] AC. So which keys common in both A. And
[214:02] that is the reason I get only a here. So
[214:05] the key which is common in both will
[214:06] appear. That is the meaning of inner
[214:08] join. Okay. Outer join will have the
[214:10] keys from both the left and the right
[214:12] data frames. So I'll get uh a b as well
[214:15] as c.
[214:21] Yep. So outer join will give you all
[214:23] three. And if you notice here in the
[214:26] case of B I don't have the age values
[214:29] and in the case of C I don't have the uh
[214:32] marks. Okay. Because in your marks data
[214:34] frame there was no C and in your age
[214:37] data frame there was no B. Okay. That is
[214:40] why we have the missing values of marks
[214:42] for C and missing value of age for B.
[214:46] Right? A was present in both the data
[214:49] frames. So both marks and age were
[214:52] updated accordingly.
[214:54] You can also do a simple concatenation
[214:56] of your data frames back to back. Okay.
[214:59] So in this case I created another data
[215:02] frame uh DF3 and this is coming from
[215:05] DF1. This is my DF1 and this is simply
[215:09] F3. So concatenation means the data
[215:12] frames will be just concatenated one
[215:14] below the other. Why one below the
[215:16] other? Because by default the axis is
[215:18] again zero. If you change the axis to
[215:21] one, then they will be concatenated side
[215:24] by side. Okay, remember that. So if you
[215:26] want this kind of concatenation, you
