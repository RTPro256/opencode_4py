[96:44] have hardcoded values of the constants
[96:49] which can make it difficult if you want
[96:52] to reuse the code or if you want to
[96:54] debug the code. Okay. So for example
[96:56] here you want to return the discounted
[96:58] price. So the function name is good
[97:01] calculate the discount and it takes the
[97:03] input as the price and the 10% of that
[97:07] price will be the total discount. But
[97:09] the problem here is that 10% discount is
[97:12] hardcoded. So later on if you want to
[97:14] change that discount rate you might want
[97:17] to dig down where that function is
[97:19] present and then back to this variable.
[97:21] So not a good idea. uh can we provide
[97:24] that discount rate as a more like a
[97:26] global variable and then use that
[97:28] because functions by default can access
[97:30] all the global variables. So you are
[97:32] accessing that discount rate which is
[97:34] set to be a constant in this notebook
[97:37] let's say and that uses the discount
[97:39] rate to calculate the total discount. So
[97:41] that is more readable and uh easier to
[97:44] change because now you just have to
[97:46] change the value present in this
[97:48] variable. Now I'll demonstrate how to
[97:52] write down proper comments and commented
[97:54] blocks of code. So even before going to
[97:58] that there is one bad code example which
[98:02] tries to comment every single line of
[98:04] code even though the code might be quite
[98:07] obvious. This is also not a good idea.
[98:10] So for example if you see in this case
[98:12] x= 10, y= 20 and z= x + y. So these are
[98:18] the comments assign 10 to x assign 20 to
[98:22] y and then add x and y. So it's very
[98:24] clear that I'm assigning x as 10 y as
[98:28] 20. So there was no need of these
[98:29] comments actually and this operation is
[98:32] also quite self-explanatory right. So in
[98:34] a good code you don't need to actually
[98:36] uh so this is again a constant birth
[98:38] year current year and I am trying to get
[98:41] the difference between the current year
[98:42] and the birth year to calculate the age.
[98:44] So this calculation may not be very
[98:47] intuitive. So that's the reason I have
[98:50] uh provided a comment here. But I
[98:52] skipped providing the comments in these
