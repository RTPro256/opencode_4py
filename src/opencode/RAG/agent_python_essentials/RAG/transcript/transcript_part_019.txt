[40:04] understand.
[40:07] So before we start with conditional
[40:09] statements, let's have a quick look into
[40:11] the indentation and comments in Python.
[40:14] So indentation means providing spaces
[40:16] and tabs which are used at the beginning
[40:17] of any statement. So these statements
[40:20] with the same indentation will belong to
[40:22] the same group. So here in this code I
[40:25] am defining a five and then bs6 but here
[40:30] I have got a indentation of one tab. Uh
[40:33] one tab is equivalent to four white
[40:35] spaces. Typically you can see this in
[40:38] your settings text editor indentation
[40:40] and the default is four white spaces. So
[40:43] you can actually count there are four
[40:45] white spaces here 1 2 3 and four. Okay,
[40:49] here the indentation is not expected and
[40:52] this will give me an error. Why is it
[40:54] not expected? Because indentations are
[40:56] typically expected in control structures
[41:00] like if else statements, try catch
[41:02] statements, for and while loops,
[41:05] function and class definitions and so
[41:07] on. Here you have the if else statement
[41:09] here. So I'm checking whether 2 is equal
[41:12] to 20 or not. So this will give me
[41:15] false. So I can change this to two. So
[41:19] now I'm checking whether two is equal to
[41:21] two. So this will make it true. So if
[41:24] true that means I'm entering the if
[41:26] condition. This print statement will be
[41:28] printed. Correct. But if I just forgot
[41:33] to give this indentation. Let's see what
[41:35] happens.
[41:37] It says that indentation error expected
[41:40] an indented block after the if
[41:42] statement. So remember that whenever you
[41:44] are using the if statement or any of the
[41:48] loops and function definitions the first
[41:51] line onwards everything have to be
[41:54] indented. Okay. So here indentation is
[41:56] mandatory. This helps Python to know
[41:59] that this statement has to execute
[42:02] whenever this condition is true. Okay.
[42:06] Now you can write down comments in
[42:08] Python by using hash mark before the
[42:12] place where you want to place your
[42:14] comments. Okay. So you can start your
[42:20] comments at the end of the lines code
