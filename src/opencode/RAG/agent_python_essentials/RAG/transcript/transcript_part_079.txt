[168:42] zero is the location which is the
[168:44] location of the mean. So the data one
[168:47] will have a mean at zero, standard
[168:48] deviation at one. I'll have 100 data
[168:51] points. The second data array has got
[168:53] mean at five and the standard deviation
[168:56] as two. and the third one will have a
[168:58] mean at minus3 and a standard deviation
[169:01] of 1.5. Okay, all three will have 100
[169:04] values. Again, a figure created and a
[169:07] box plot. So, I'm just clubbing all
[169:09] these three and providing some tick
[169:12] labels here. Let's see how the box plot
[169:15] comes up. Okay, so you can see these
[169:18] lines represent the median value. Okay,
[169:22] these orange lines, they represent the
[169:25] median value. You have the lower whisker
[169:27] and the upper whisker. This is the edge
[169:30] of the box. Lower edge which represents
[169:32] the first quartile. This is the second
[169:35] quartile. The median value. This is the
[169:37] third quartile. Okay. For any box plot.
[169:40] So the total height of the box will be
[169:42] given by the interquartile range Q3
[169:44] minus Q1. Okay. Same goes for all the
[169:46] other two plots. Okay. So once again
[169:49] this is my Q1 value, Q2 value and Q3
[169:52] value. And you have the total length of
[169:55] this whisker as 1 and a half times of
[169:57] the interquartile range. That is the
[169:59] length of the box times 1.5 is the total
[170:03] height here. And some of the outliers
[170:05] you can see which is going beyond the
[170:07] upper limit. Okay. So otherwise if there
[170:10] are no circles above and below then
[170:12] these horizontal lines would represent
[170:15] the maximum value and the minimum value.
[170:17] So here it represents the minimum value.
[170:19] Again this is the minimum value and the
[170:21] maximum value in that distribution. But
[170:23] here the minimum value is represented by
[170:25] the circles and not this because we have
[170:27] values below the horizontal line. So the
[170:30] horizontal line cannot be the minimum
[170:31] value. Right? So this is the minimum
[170:33] value and this is again the maximum
[170:36] value. So you get all the information
[170:38] about the distribution in terms of the
[170:40] box plot. Okay. We can also go with pie
[170:43] charts. So I have created some slices
