[53:14] simplify your code. In the next session,
[53:17] we'll continue building these concepts
[53:18] to make our programs even more dynamic
[53:20] and interactive.
[53:23] So, let's start with opening our
[53:25] Anaconda prompt. So, from the Anaconda
[53:29] prompt, let me browse to the directory
[53:32] where my files are kept.
[53:36] Okay. And from here, Jupiter notebook.
[53:42] Okay. So my Jupyter notebook is up and
[53:46] running. I have my code files here,
[53:50] module one, and we'll go on to looping
[53:53] constructs in this video.
[53:57] Okay, in this coding tutorial, we'll
[54:00] have a look into how to use the for and
[54:02] the while loop.
[54:04] So let's start with the for loop first.
[54:07] So we would use the for loop when we
[54:10] want to run a block of code certain
[54:12] number of times. So you are already
[54:15] clear that you will be running your
[54:17] block of code some specific number of
[54:20] times then for loop is the best choice.
[54:24] Okay. So here is a simple example for
[54:28] number in range four. So range is
[54:30] actually a generator function.
[54:33] This will create indices from zero to
[54:38] the stop number minus one. So it will
[54:40] create index from 0 1 2 and 3. So
[54:44] essentially this number in the first
[54:46] iteration will take a value of zero.
[54:48] Then in the next iteration this number
[54:50] will take a value of 1 then two and then
[54:53] three. It will stop one before the stop
[54:55] index. Okay. So let's print this and
[54:57] see. So essentially I'm running this for
[55:00] loop for four times. That's exactly what
[55:04] this for loop statement says. I want to
[55:07] run a for loop for four iterations.
[55:11] So this number will pick up the values
[55:13] from the range generator.
[55:16] Okay. Now let's say you do not want to
[55:18] start from zero. You want to start from
[55:20] some other number. Let's say in this
[55:22] case one. Then you can give
[55:25] uh two arguments to the range function.
[55:27] The first argument is your starting
[55:29] point and the second becomes the end
[55:31] point. As usual again remember that the
[55:35] number will stop or the iterations will
