[111:47] used. So this is also acceptable. In
[111:51] this last demonstration here, we are
[111:53] going to demonstrate the PEP 257 style
[111:57] guidelines. So, PEP 257 talks about the
[112:00] dockstring standards for Python coding.
[112:03] So, typically
[112:05] uh the dock strings should describe the
[112:07] purpose, the input and the output
[112:10] parameters of that function and what it
[112:12] returns. So everything that you see just
[112:16] below the function definition which is
[112:18] present within these three double quotes
[112:20] this is called as doc string in short or
[112:23] documentation string. If you define a
[112:25] function without the documentation
[112:27] string it's still usable. You can see
[112:30] I'm able to create a function which
[112:32] calculates the volume of a cylinder by
[112:34] taking the radius and the height of the
[112:36] cylinder as input and I'm able to call
[112:39] that function by giving some value for
[112:41] the radius and the height. However, when
[112:43] I do a shift tab tab to check the
[112:47] functions documentation here, you can
[112:50] see very clearly there is no
[112:51] documentation string mentioned because
[112:54] we deleted that documentation string.
[112:56] Now, let me post it back
[112:58] uh reinitialize the function and then
[113:02] use the function. So, the functionality
[113:04] didn't change at all. However, if you
[113:06] see now I'm going to do shift tab tab by
[113:09] placing my cursor within the function.
[113:11] So this balloon pop-up appears which
[113:13] talks about the dock string. So this
[113:16] gives me a clear indication what this
[113:18] function does in this case calculating
[113:21] the cylinders uh volume using a radius
[113:25] and height as the input. What are the
[113:27] input arguments and their formats and
[113:29] what the function returns in this case
[113:31] which is clearly the volume of the
[113:33] cylinder in the float format. Right? So
[113:35] this is the appropriate way of uh
[113:38] defining the functions and further we
[113:40] are using them. So that's all for this
[113:42] video. Thank you.
[113:45] Hello everyone and welcome to this
[113:47] session on numpy. Numpy is a cornerstone
[113:50] of Python's data science ecosystem
