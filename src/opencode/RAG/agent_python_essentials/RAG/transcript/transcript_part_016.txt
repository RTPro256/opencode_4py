[33:44] and this is true, the net thing will
[33:47] give me true. So true and true will give
[33:50] me true. This is true. This is false. So
[33:54] true or false will give me again true.
[33:57] That is how the truth table for the or
[33:59] operator works. So and operator will
[34:02] give you true only when both of them are
[34:04] true. If either of them are false. Okay,
[34:08] let me make it clear. So let's make it
[34:11] 20 here. So this is true but this is
[34:14] false. Right? So this will give me
[34:17] false.
[34:18] So and operator will return true only if
[34:21] both of these conditions are actually
[34:24] returned to be true. Okay.
[34:25] Simultaneously if either or both of them
[34:28] are false then the net returned output
[34:31] would be false. You can see here. Okay.
[34:34] So this will go back to true. But in the
[34:36] case of R operation there are two
[34:39] conditions again which I'm checking. So
[34:41] if either of them are true, it will give
[34:43] me true. So this is true. This is false
[34:45] and still it gives me true. Okay. But if
[34:48] both are false, let's say this is 10
[34:51] now. Okay. So one is not equal to 10. So
[34:53] this is false. Three is not equal to
[34:56] four. This is also false. So false or
[34:59] false will return me false. If either of
[35:01] them is true, then it will give me true.
[35:03] You can see that. Okay. Now you can go
[35:06] for more compound operations. Okay. So
[35:09] you can uh focus on the bracket here. So
[35:13] first I'm checking this condition within
[35:16] this bracket and then I am compounding
[35:20] it with the or operation with this
[35:22] condition. Okay. So first we check
[35:24] whether two is greater than three. This
[35:26] will give me false. This will give me
[35:28] true. So false or true will give me
[35:33] true. So the output from here to here
[35:35] will be true. Now this is true and this
[35:38] is already true. So the net thing should
[35:40] return to be true. That's it for this
[35:43] coding exercise. I'll see you in the
[35:45] next part. Hello and welcome back. In
[35:48] this video, we'll explore conditional
[35:51] statements, a fundamental concept in
[35:53] Python that helps us to make decisions
[35:56] in our code. If you have ever wondered
