[139:13] gives you the same result. If you can
[139:15] see x multiplied by y is also an array
[139:19] is also an elementwise multiplication.
[139:22] You can see this result matches with
[139:23] this result. And similarly x divided by
[139:27] y is also an element-wise operation. You
[139:30] can see each element of the array 1 2 3
[139:33] 4 was divided by the elements 10 20 30
[139:37] 40 respectively. So each of them become
[139:39] 0.1. Perfect. You can take the log by
[139:42] default. So I've created some array
[139:44] again. Here I have got the npe e which
[139:47] is a constant e in mathematics the
[139:51] exponent e. So 2.718 value and one value
[139:55] is one and the other value is 100. So
[139:57] three values I'll be using for log
[139:59] calculations. So by default this will
[140:02] give you the natural logarithm with the
[140:05] base e. What is that value of e? 2.718.
[140:08] So the base for this logarithm is this
[140:11] e. And that is why the value of log for
[140:15] that e is one. Okay. Log one is always
[140:18] zero. So that's what I got here. And
[140:20] this is the log of 100 with the base e.
[140:24] Now you can change the base to two. In
[140:26] that case the two base log values are
[140:30] these. So log of e to the base 2 is 1.44
[140:34] and log of 100 to the base 2 is 6.64 and
[140:38] so on. Now here you are changing the
[140:40] base to log to 10. So again the log of 1
[140:45] is 0. This is the log of e to the base
[140:48] 10. And this is the log of 100 to the
[140:52] base of 10 which is two in this case. So
[140:54] npe e is same as np.exp with the power
[140:58] of one. You can use this function to
[141:01] raise some powers to this e. Okay. So
[141:04] the values are the same 2.718. So the
[141:07] exponential functions. So I have the
[141:09] same array 2 3 4. I am going to use this
[141:12] array as exponents. Okay. So I'll be
[141:15] using the function called as power. So
[141:18] each element of this array will be
[141:20] raised to the power of 2 in this case.
[141:22] Okay. So I'll get 2 square which is 4, 3
[141:25] square which is 9 and 4 squared which is
[141:27] 16. So let me print this 4 9 and 16.
[141:31] Perfect. And what are these three
[141:33] numbers? These are basically the
[141:34] exponent e raised to the power of these
[141:38] numbers. Okay. So this is essentially e
