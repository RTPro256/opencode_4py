[210:54] median value that you specify. So by
[210:57] default access is zero which means the
[210:59] entire row will be dropped. Okay,
[211:01] whichever row contains a single missing
[211:04] value that will be dropped. Okay, any
[211:07] means any single row which contains a
[211:10] missing value will be dropped. So if you
[211:12] want to drop columns then make sure that
[211:14] you keep axis equal to one. So let me
[211:16] just drop and you can see that the row
[211:18] number four and the row number seven
[211:20] they got dropped. Yeah, row four and row
[211:23] 7 are missing now. Good that we created
[211:25] a copy. So my original data frame is
[211:28] still the same unchanged. What if you
[211:31] have duplicates in your data frame? So I
[211:33] am creating a simple data frame with
[211:35] duplicates here. So this entire record
[211:38] is duplicated two times. You can see. So
[211:41] I want to drop the duplicates. So you
[211:44] can use the function drop duplicates. So
[211:46] by default again it will drop the rows
[211:49] and by default again it will have the in
[211:52] place option which is set to false. So
[211:54] again you can set in place equal to true
[211:57] or type cast it back to the original
[211:59] data frame. So after dropping replace
[212:02] your df2. So that is another option or
[212:05] you use the in place equal to true
[212:06] either of. So I have dropped my uh
[212:09] duplicate rows and uh you can also do
[212:14] some operations on your strings. So for
[212:16] example here the subject names I want to
[212:20] convert them into lower case. So I'm
[212:23] type casting the subject values into a
[212:26] string and then converting that string
[212:28] into a lower case and then replacing the
[212:30] original column. So after converting the
[212:33] string values into lower case, I'm
[212:36] replacing my original column. So that's
[212:39] how I get here. So the subject now is
[212:42] becoming in lower case. So all these
[212:45] operations you can do depending on your
[212:46] use case. Now let's have a look how can
[212:49] we merge and join data frames. I'm
[212:51] creating a couple of dummy data frames
[212:53] DF1 and DF2. I've got two names A and B
[212:58] uh with mark set as 198 and 1817. In the
[213:01] other one I've got age of these two
[213:03] students A and C as 17 and 18. So I can
