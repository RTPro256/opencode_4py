[46:57] zero. So if condition was not satisfied.
[47:00] So automatically the control went to the
[47:02] else and so odd was printed. Now I
[47:04] repeat this. Let me provide some big
[47:07] number. However big that doesn't matter.
[47:10] This number when divided by two leaves a
[47:12] remainder of zero and hence the print
[47:16] statement corresponding to E1 was
[47:18] printed here. Now in the second problem,
[47:20] I'm going to take the user input and u
[47:23] assign it to another variable y. Okay,
[47:26] by default again this y will be in the
[47:29] string format. I have to type cast it
[47:31] into a integer and then I have to print
[47:34] the grade whether the grade is a, b or f
[47:38] based on the score provided by the user.
[47:42] So the grade is greater than 90. If the
[47:45] number is greater than 90 then I'll
[47:47] assign a grade a. If the number is
[47:49] greater than 60, I'll assign it to be
[47:51] grade B and else the student fails. So
[47:56] let me provide some number. Let's say
[47:58] 95.
[48:00] Okay, fantastic. I got grade A. Let me
[48:03] rerun this with another number. Let's
[48:05] say 72. So what happened here? First Y
[48:09] is checked to be greater than 90. So
[48:11] right now your Y is 72. 72 is certainly
[48:14] not greater than 90. So this condition
[48:17] is not satisfied. So control
[48:19] automatically went to the lf. So this
[48:21] condition is checked now whether 72 is
[48:23] greater than 60. Yes. So this print
[48:26] statement got executed and the program
[48:29] stops. Okay. So only one of these three
[48:33] statements will always execute. Only one
[48:36] of these three will execute. If this is
[48:38] true, this will execute and stop. If
[48:40] this is not true, then it will check
[48:42] whether this is true. If this is true,
[48:44] this will execute and stop. If both of
[48:47] them are not true, then the control
[48:49] automatically goes to the last else
[48:51] statement and this is always printed. So
[48:55] if you want, you can check it once again
[48:57] with another number 45. Yes, 45 is a
[49:00] failure grade.
[49:03] I'm thrilled to welcome you to this
[49:05] video on looping constructs in Python.
[49:07] Loops are incredibly powerful. They
