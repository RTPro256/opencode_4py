[258:57] Postgress database both hosted on a AWS
[259:00] server which is most likely going to be
[259:03] a production environment in any uh real
[259:06] life scenario for any enterprise. So
[259:09] let's get started.
[259:11] Okay. So you will need to install the
[259:14] SQLite3 package if it is not present. So
[259:18] you can do that by doing a pip install
[259:23] sqite 3. I'm not running this because uh
[259:28] this package is already installed in my
[259:30] system. So and then pandas would be most
[259:34] likely installed in your system u if you
[259:36] are using anaconda or Google collab.
[259:39] Here I'm creating a SQLite database
[259:44] by connecting it to memory. So this
[259:46] database will be created in your RAM
[259:49] which is the memory I'm going to specify
[259:51] here. And then once the connection has
[259:53] been made to that database, I'm going to
[259:55] create a cursor object. This cursor
[259:58] object will be used to execute the SQL
[260:00] commands. So that has been done. Uh now
[260:03] I'm going to execute
[260:06] a create table query which is going to
[260:09] create a small table named as students.
[260:13] And this students table will have
[260:17] columns like ID, name, age and marks uh
[260:23] for few subjects like statistics,
[260:25] Python, machine learning and deep
[260:26] learning. So these will be the columns
[260:28] in my table. The name of the table is
[260:31] students and this students table will be
[260:34] created in your database. So I'm passing
[260:37] that entire query string to execute and
[260:41] who is going to execute the cursor.
[260:43] Okay, let's see. Okay, so the students
[260:46] table has been created. Now I'm going to
[260:48] insert some data into that table. Okay,
[260:51] so for that I'm using the insert into
[260:53] command. So insert into students and
[260:57] these are the column names and there are
[261:01] some uh entries that I have specified.
[261:04] So these are some names of the students
[261:06] their age then marks in statistics then
[261:09] the marks in Python marks in machine
[261:12] learning and deep learning. Okay. So
[261:14] these are pretty much standard SQL
[261:16] commands. Uh if you are familiar you can
[261:19] easily relate to it. And uh if SQL is a
[261:23] bit new to you, I would strongly
