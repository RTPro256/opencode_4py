[359:54] file and then other configurations are
[359:56] there. So the main thing is this model
[359:58] itself. Can you see the safe tensors
[360:01] corresponds to the weights of this
[360:03] model. So essentially what you are
[360:06] downloading is the model weights which
[360:08] is corresponding to roughly 4.97 GB.
[360:11] Okay. So my model has been downloaded to
[360:14] Google Collab server. You can see almost
[360:17] 5.5 GB of space is being consumed
[360:20] already. So let's try out some basic
[360:23] prompting.
[360:24] So first I have to create a message. So
[360:27] setting the user as a role and content
[360:30] to be the actual prompt. So I am going
[360:33] to prompt my model to explain what is AI
[360:36] in three bullet points. So that is the
[360:38] chat which I'm passing to the apply chat
[360:42] template function from the tokenizer and
[360:45] uh this will tokenize
[360:47] and print the prompt.
[360:50] Okay. So basically what I'm doing is uh
[360:56] how this prompt is interpreted by the
[360:59] model. Okay. So BOS is basically the
[361:02] beginning of sentence. And these are
[361:05] special tags you can say which are
[361:08] passed to the model so that the model
[361:10] knows what is the system message and
[361:12] what is the user's actual prompt. Okay.
[361:15] So these are all like system message you
[361:17] can say. These are tags, special tags
[361:19] for that. And within the user, this is
[361:22] where the actual prompt lies, right?
[361:26] So let's see the model do device. This
[361:29] should give me CUDA index zero. So this
[361:32] is CUDA is referring to the GPU. So
[361:34] right now my model has been mounted on
[361:37] the GPU. Uh let's encode this prompt. So
[361:43] when the prompt gets encoded basically
[361:45] it will give the token ids and those
[361:51] token ids are used as input by the model
[361:54] to generate the outputs right so so the
[361:58] input and outputs would be token ids
[362:00] essentially okay now I'm using the
[362:02] output token ids to decode the actual
[362:07] English words from these token ids okay
[362:11] so token ids would be numbers
[362:12] essentially I am using the decode
[362:15] function to convert it back into a
[362:18] English language you can say right so
