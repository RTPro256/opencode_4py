[286:07] indicates that the resource was not
[286:09] found and 500 represents a server error.
[286:13] These codes help you understand whether
[286:15] your requests have been processed
[286:18] successfully or if there were any
[286:21] issues. Restful APIs. Most modern APIs
[286:24] are designed according to the rest
[286:26] architecture. Representational state
[286:29] transfer. REST is an architectural style
[286:32] used for designing applications. It
[286:35] relies on few core principles.
[286:38] Statelessness. The server doesn't store
[286:40] any client state. Meaning each request
[286:43] from the client contains all the
[286:45] information that the server needs to
[286:47] fulfill that request. Client server
[286:50] architecture. This separates the user
[286:52] interface from data storage simplifying
[286:55] how applications interact with APIs.
[286:58] Uniform interface. All API endpoints use
[287:01] standard methods and formats making it
[287:03] easier to use and understand.
[287:06] Cachability.
[287:07] Responses can be cached for improved
[287:10] performance. Restful APIs use HTTP
[287:13] methods like get, post, put, and delete
[287:17] for crude operations which include
[287:20] create, read, update, and delete
[287:24] operations. This makes them
[287:26] straightforward to work once you
[287:28] understand these principles. A restful
[287:30] API interaction involves several
[287:33] components. The endpoint or resource URL
[287:37] specifies where the resource is located.
[287:40] The HTTP method indicates what action
[287:42] you want to perform on the resource.
[287:44] Headers carry metadata information like
[287:47] content type or authentication tokens.
[287:50] This helps the server understand how to
[287:53] process the request or who is making the
[287:55] request. The body or payload contains
[287:58] data you are sending to the server
[288:00] commonly in the JSON format. Finally,
[288:03] after pre-processing your request, the
[288:05] server sends a response in JSON format,
[288:08] which also includes headers and the
[288:10] requested data. Understanding these
[288:12] components is essential for effectively
[288:14] working with APIs. JSON is the most
[288:16] commonly used data format for APIs. It's
