[84:05] the positional arguments have to be
[84:06] defined. Okay. Before the keyword
[84:09] arguments, correct? So this will again
[84:12] work. Now let's have a look into the
[84:14] scopes of the variables within the
[84:16] functions and out of the functions. So
[84:19] what do you mean by the scope of a
[84:20] variable? So this is the part of the
[84:23] program where we can access a particular
[84:25] variable. Okay. So all these variables
[84:28] that you have created in your notebook
[84:30] right now can be accessed from the
[84:32] global name space here. So you can see
[84:34] the global name space has all the
[84:36] functions in the memory. These are the
[84:38] memory locations in which all your
[84:40] functions are right now present. Okay,
[84:42] along with that all the variables that
[84:44] you have created is also present here.
[84:46] Your name output 1 2 3 and welcome. So
[84:49] all these are the functions and
[84:51] variables that you have created in this
[84:52] particular notebook. So this is the
[84:55] scope the global scope of this notebook.
[84:58] Okay. So this is where your all the
[85:02] variables are stored. So global variable
[85:05] and local variable. So each function has
[85:09] its own local scope or name space where
[85:14] it stores the variables and those
[85:17] variables are called as the local
[85:18] variables. So first let's see I have got
[85:22] a variable called as name which is
[85:25] defined outside the function. So by
[85:27] default any variable which is defined
[85:30] out of the functions they are in the
[85:32] global namespace. Okay, they are in the
[85:34] global namespace. Global namespace means
[85:36] this is a global namespace because all
[85:38] these variables were defined out of the
[85:41] function. So this will go into the
[85:43] global namespace. All the functions
[85:47] which are present in the global
[85:49] namespace. You can see that the there
[85:50] are the functions which we created. So
[85:52] these functions present in the global
[85:54] namespace will have access to all the
[85:57] variables present in the so these
[85:59] functions will have access to all these
[86:01] variables.
[86:02] All these functions will have access to
