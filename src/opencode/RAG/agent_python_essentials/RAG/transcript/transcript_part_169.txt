[369:11] definitely this looks quite positive
[369:14] response. The reviewer has expressed
[369:17] satisfaction and these are the key
[369:19] phrases. So can I prify it and display?
[369:23] Perfect. So this is a prettyified
[369:26] display. So that's all in this coding
[369:29] hands-on tutorial on using the large
[369:32] language models on your local machine by
[369:35] downloading it from the hugging face
[369:37] repository.
[369:40] Hi and welcome back. As AI has evolved,
[369:44] so have the frameworks and tools
[369:46] designed to help us build more advanced
[369:48] and autonomous systems. Now, instead of
[369:51] starting from scratch, we have powerful
[369:53] tools that make it easier to create,
[369:55] manage, and deploy AI agents. I'll
[369:58] introduce you to some of these tools in
[369:59] this video. These tools will be used
[370:02] more comprehensively later in the
[370:04] further courses of this program. In this
[370:06] session, we'll explore four key tools in
[370:08] AI development. Langchain, Langraph,
[370:10] Creai, and Autogen. We'll talk about
[370:14] what each tool does the best, some
[370:16] practical use cases, and a comparison to
[370:19] help you decide which one might fit your
[370:21] needs. Let's get started. But first, why
[370:24] do we need specialized tools to build AI
[370:26] agents? Well, let's consider some of the
[370:29] challenges. First, building these agents
[370:32] is complex. Second, integration can be a
[370:35] real challenge. Each agent might need to
[370:38] pull data from multiple sources, talk to
[370:41] different systems, and work well with
[370:43] other models. And third, scalability. As
[370:46] your agent grows in capabilities, it
[370:49] needs to handle more tasks, more users,
[370:52] and often needs to perform consistently
[370:55] as it scales. So what are the solutions?
[370:58] We are talking about AI that can
[371:00] understand language, make decisions, and
[371:03] even take action. So it's a lot to
[371:06] handle especially when you want to
[371:08] develop something quickly and make it
[371:11] flexible. These tools make the process
[371:13] smoother and help integrate everything
[371:16] into a single workflow. Tools like
[371:18] langen and autogen simplify all these
[371:20] tasks reducing development time and
