[270:54] alchemy. If this is already installed,
[270:56] you can delete this part and just
[270:58] install the SQL alchemy part. So once
[271:00] your SQL alchemy is installed, I'm just
[271:03] importing the SQL alchemy create engine
[271:05] function. Okay. So you are creating a
[271:09] connection string first. You are passing
[271:11] the username, password, host name and
[271:13] the database uh name here. Right? So
[271:17] this is your connection string which you
[271:19] are passing it to the create engine. So
[271:21] you are creating a SQL alchemy engine.
[271:24] Let's see.
[271:26] Done. So I'm going to use that
[271:29] connection engine into the read SQL
[271:31] function of pandas. Okay. So whatever
[271:34] your query string as usual and your
[271:36] connection engine. So these two things
[271:38] will be needed to fire any SQL query and
[271:41] directly fetch the results as a data
[271:44] frame. So this is the biggest
[271:45] difference. Here we were uh fetching the
[271:48] details and row by row we were printing
[271:51] it. Okay, we are not getting the data
[271:53] frame here. Neither we are getting the
[271:55] data frame here. So here we are going to
[271:57] fetch all the details directly as a data
[271:59] frame. So that is the main advantage
[272:01] here. Perfect. So all my data is there
[272:04] as a data frame. So let's execute some
[272:06] SQL queries using the pandas read SQL
[272:09] function. So first query is the same uh
[272:12] reading all the data from the students
[272:13] table. Now I'm going to filter records
[272:16] by some condition. Let's say I want to
[272:19] fetch only those students who scored
[272:21] more than 85 in Python. So these are the
[272:23] students who have scored more than 85 in
[272:26] Python. You can just check their marks.
[272:28] These are all greater than 85. So there
[272:31] are 20 students uh with the index 0 to
[272:34] 19. Out of 20 students, 16 students have
[272:38] scored more than 85 in Python. Next, you
[272:42] can also select specific columns for
[272:44] example name and statistics in this
[272:46] case. So select name, statistics marks
[272:49] from all the students. So now I'm
[272:51] getting the name and the statistics
[272:53] marks for all the students in this case.
[272:56] You can also order the records by
