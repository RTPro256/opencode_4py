[268:35] be able to catch that error and print
[268:37] it. Okay, so that's exactly what I'm
[268:40] doing here. So if there is an er error,
[268:43] I'll catch that error and print this.
[268:45] Okay, if everything goes well, this is
[268:47] what will get printed connected to my
[268:49] SQL database. Perfect. So it's connected
[268:53] and uh this part is again the same. I'm
[268:56] just creating a cursor to execute my SQL
[268:59] query and then fetching all the five
[269:00] rows and printing it one by one. So the
[269:02] main difference here is you get the
[269:05] output as a tpple. You directly get the
[269:07] values. Okay. In the previous case you
[269:10] are getting the key and the values. The
[269:14] key names where the column names. So the
[269:17] keys are the column names. Okay. Sorry.
[269:20] This is the key. This is the key. This
[269:22] is another key. So key names are
[269:24] basically the columns names and the
[269:27] values are there. So it's a key value
[269:29] pairs which is a dictionary. So each row
[269:31] comes up as a dictionary. However, in
[269:34] this case, you'll get directly the
[269:36] values present in each row as a tpple.
[269:39] So one tpple represents one row. Okay?
[269:41] So this is one difference. So you can
[269:44] decide what suits your application
[269:46] better. Okay? Uh okay. And this is a
[269:50] more uh graceful way of closing your
[269:52] connection. If it is already open, okay,
[269:55] if it is connected, then close it. If it
[269:57] is not connected then anyway these two
[270:00] statements will not execute. Now let's
[270:02] see how can we connect pandas to MySQL
[270:07] database and execute direct queries
[270:10] using pandas. Okay. So the first two
[270:13] steps are already done. You can actually
[270:15] use MySQL connector or py my SQL and SQL
[270:21] alchemy. So you will need a SQL alchemy
[270:23] engine to connect to Python pandas so
[270:28] that you can fire the SQL commands. So
[270:32] the SQL commands will be passed to the
[270:34] reads SQL function once we have
[270:37] established the connection using SQL
[270:39] alchemy. So this will be needed. Okay.
[270:42] Plus one of these two connectors will be
[270:44] needed. So let's see uh you'll need to
[270:47] unccommend this to install uh pi MySQL
[270:51] or uh MySQL connector along with SQL
