[246:06] sets for training and inference. Imagine
[246:09] developing a recommendation system for a
[246:11] streaming platform. The data for user
[246:13] preferences and content metadata has to
[246:16] be pulled from a central repository
[246:18] which will be a database. Additionally,
[246:20] logging and monitoring play an important
[246:22] role in maintaining systems. Databases
[246:25] are used to store user interaction logs
[246:28] which can be analyzed to improve
[246:31] performance and user experience. Tools
[246:33] for connecting Python to SQL databases.
[246:36] There are several tools and libraries
[246:38] available for connecting Python to SQL
[246:40] databases. For MySQL, popular Python
[246:43] libraries include MySQL connector Python
[246:47] and PI MySQL libraries. For Postgress
[246:50] SQL, there's PsychoPG2 and PG8000
[246:54] library. For those who prefer OM
[246:56] framework that abstracts away the raw
[246:59] SQL code, SQL Alchemy is a powerful
[247:02] option that supports multiple databases.
[247:05] OM help in interacting with database
[247:07] using Python classes and methods instead
[247:10] of writing raw SQL queries.
[247:11] Additionally, pandas also integrates
[247:13] well with SQL functions like pandas.SQL
[247:16] ReadSQL query make it easy to import
[247:20] data into a data frame while the
[247:23] two_SSQL
[247:25] method lets you write data from a data
[247:28] frame to a SQL table. Another
[247:30] interesting concept is in-memory
[247:33] databases and SQLite is a great example.
[247:37] An in-memory database resides entirely
[247:40] in your systems RAM making read and
[247:42] write operations extremely fast.
[247:44] However, the data is volatile, meaning
[247:47] it is lost when the application
[247:49] terminates. In-memory databases are
[247:51] perfect for testing and development
[247:53] because they provide fresh database
[247:55] state for each test run. They are also
[247:58] ideal for applications requiring quick
[248:00] data access like caching or managing
[248:03] session data that doesn't need long-term
[248:06] persistence. Creating an in-memory
[248:08] SQLite database in Python is very
[248:10] straightforward. By passing memory to
[248:14] SQLite 3.Connect function, we tell
