[35:59] how a program knows what to do based on
[36:03] different inputs or conditions, well,
[36:06] this is it. Let's dive right in.
[36:09] Conditional statements help us make
[36:11] decisions within our code. Imagine you
[36:13] are coming home from work. If you are
[36:15] home on time, you might cook dinner, but
[36:18] if you are late, you might just order
[36:20] food. This kind of decision making is
[36:23] exactly what conditional statements
[36:26] allow us to model in Python. We use
[36:28] conditional statements for various
[36:30] purposes such as making decisions,
[36:34] controlling the flow of the program,
[36:36] validating inputs, and even handling
[36:39] errors gracefully. They form the
[36:41] backbone of any program that needs to
[36:44] adapt to different situations. Let's
[36:46] break down a scenario. Picture this. You
[36:49] arrive home. That's our event. Now,
[36:52] there are two possible conditions.
[36:54] Either you arrive on time or you arrive
[36:56] late. If you are on time, you decide to
[36:59] cook dinner. But if you are late, you
[37:02] decide to order food. This is exactly
[37:04] what conditional statements in Python
[37:06] do. We set up conditions and based on
[37:09] whether they are true or false, we
[37:11] determine the appropriate action to
[37:13] take. It's like a flowchart for decision
[37:16] making. Quite intuitive, right? Python
[37:18] gives us several types of conditional
[37:20] statements. The simple if statement
[37:23] executes code only if a condition is
[37:25] true. The if else statement to specify
[37:28] what should happen if the condition is
[37:30] false. The if l if else statement for
[37:34] handling multiple conditions in
[37:35] sequence. And finally the nested if
[37:38] statements where you have an if
[37:40] statement inside another if statement.
[37:42] These different types of conditional
[37:44] statements allow us to write complex
[37:46] decision-making logic in our programs.
[37:48] Here's a quick look at some pseudo codes
[37:50] to help understand how we write
[37:52] conditional statements. If our condition
[37:54] is that the arrival time is greater than
[37:57] 10 p.m., we decide to order food. If
[37:59] it's earlier, we cook instead. This
