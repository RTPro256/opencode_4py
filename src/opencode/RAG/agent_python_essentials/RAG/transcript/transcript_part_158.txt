[343:46] module and then we are going to create a
[343:48] payload and the model API URLs as the
[343:52] inputs to the query function. So this uh
[343:55] userdefined query function will take the
[343:57] payload and the model API which we want
[344:00] to hit. Okay. So we are making a post
[344:04] request to this model API URL. So
[344:08] different models will have different API
[344:10] URLs and we'll also pass the uh headers
[344:14] which will have my authentication uh
[344:16] token and we'll define a JSON payload.
[344:19] Finally, we'll get the response from the
[344:22] server after the post request is made
[344:24] and from there we'll access the JSON
[344:26] part of the response. So let me create
[344:30] this function. So there are a lot of
[344:32] settings uh you can find the detailed
[344:34] documentation by clicking on this link.
[344:36] But uh the most common configurations
[344:39] that we are going to need and you should
[344:41] be knowing is uh we can restrict the
[344:44] model to create some specific token
[344:48] limits. So if you give some max new
[344:51] tokens value here let's say 200 or 500.
[344:55] So the model will create maximum that
[344:59] many tokens. Okay, so this is the number
[345:02] of tokens you want your model to create
[345:04] in the response. Temperature again the
[345:07] value typically lies between 0 to one.
[345:10] So value closer to zero means more
[345:12] deterministic response. The same
[345:14] response will be obtained every time you
[345:16] hit the model API. So there will be less
[345:20] creativity and the model's response
[345:23] would be more realistic, lesser
[345:26] hallucinations.
[345:28] However, if the temperature value is set
[345:30] to be higher, closer to one, then the
[345:32] model's response would be more creative
[345:35] and you are allowing for more variation
[345:37] in the responses. And uh here I am
[345:40] creating the API URL. So this API URL
[345:44] you can get it from the page. So so this
[345:46] is the model card page. This is what we
[345:49] call as the model card page. So there is
[345:51] a button on the right side which says
[345:53] use this model. So by using the
[345:55] transformer API. So once you click on
[345:58] that it will give you the a short code
[346:01] which you can copy and start using. So
