[192:40] But for the gender I have got the most
[192:42] frequent value is male with a frequency
[192:44] of five and the most frequent subject
[192:47] that I have my data frame is statistics
[192:50] with a frequency of four. Let's look
[192:52] into the quick information about this
[192:54] data frame by using info function. So
[192:57] info function gives me a quick summary
[193:00] of the data frame. Eight entries means
[193:02] eight rows are present. Total five
[193:04] columns are present. So you also get the
[193:06] information about the rows and columns
[193:08] and how many non-null values are present
[193:09] in each of these columns. You can also
[193:12] see the data type of each column. So if
[193:16] you see name is in the object data type,
[193:19] gender is also the object data type.
[193:21] Subject is object data type. That's why
[193:23] I used object here so as to get the
[193:26] statistical summary. Okay. The other two
[193:30] are present as integers. So the age and
[193:32] marks these are present as integers. So
[193:35] you can actually have a look into the
[193:37] data type of each of the columns by
[193:39] using the info function.
[193:41] Now let's have a look how can we select
[193:44] and filter data. Okay. Let's say I want
[193:47] to select only the marks column out of
[193:50] my data frame. So this is a series. You
[193:52] remember individual columns of my data
[193:56] frame are going to be series. Let us
[194:00] check the data type of the data frame.
[194:02] First it shows pandas.core.frame
[194:05] data frame. And if I do the same thing
[194:08] for my type and df marks you can see the
[194:11] data type here is series. What
[194:13] essentially it means is this is
[194:16] basically a series whereas that entire
[194:20] data frame this was my data frame and
[194:22] that's 2D. Now let's do some conditional
[194:26] indexing. Okay. So you can also
[194:31] select multiple columns. Okay. So let me
[194:34] just show you how do we select multiple
[194:37] columns. Here I've only selected a
[194:38] single column marks but let's say you
[194:40] are interested in looking at two
[194:42] columns. So one is name and the other is
[194:47] marks. So if you notice what I have
[194:52] passed is basically a list of column
[194:54] names. A list of column names. Okay. For
