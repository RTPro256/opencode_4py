# Python Essentials for AI Agents - Part 131
# Video ID: UsfpzxZNsPo

[283:49] integrate advanced AI capabilities into
[283:52] your applications seamlessly. This
[283:55] includes things like natural language
[283:58] processing, language translation,
[284:00] sentiment analysis, and even
[284:03] recommendation systems. APIs make AI
[284:06] accessible without requiring in-depth
[284:09] expertise in model development.
[284:11] Interacting with LLMs via APIs typically
[284:14] involves sending a prompt or user input
[284:18] to the API which processes it using a
[284:22] sophisticated language model and then
[284:24] returns the generated response. For
[284:26] example, using the OpenAI API, you can
[284:30] send a prompt and receive a completion.
[284:32] While this is powerful, there are
[284:34] considerations like latency due to
[284:37] network communication, costs associated
[284:39] with API usage, and data privacy
[284:41] concerns, especially when sending
[284:44] sensitive information over the network.
[284:48] Hello everyone, welcome to this video on
[284:50] accessing APIs using Python. And in this
[284:54] video, we are going to explore how to
[284:56] work with APIs in Python, focusing on
[284:59] practical techniques to interact with
[285:00] web services and extract data. APIs are
[285:03] the heart of many datadriven
[285:05] applications and learning how to access
[285:08] them using Python is an essential skill
[285:10] for any data scientist or AI developer.
[285:14] Let's get started. Before we dive into
[285:16] the code part, let's understand the
[285:17] basics of HTTP protocol. HTTP which
[285:21] stands for hypertext transfer protocol
[285:25] is the foundation of data communication
[285:27] on the web. It defines how requests and
[285:31] responses are structured between a
[285:34] client and a server. There are several
[285:36] HTTP methods you will use while working
[285:39] with APIs. Get is used to retrieve data.
[285:43] Post is used to submit new data to the
[285:45] server. Put is used to update existing
[285:48] data. Delete is used to remove data.
[285:51] These methods allow us to interact with
[285:53] data on a remote server. Understanding
[285:55] these HTTP methods is key to working
[285:59] with any API. Also, you will come across
[286:01] status codes. For example, 200 means
[286:05] success, 404
