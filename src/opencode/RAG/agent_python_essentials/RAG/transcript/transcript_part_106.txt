[228:32] DF1 and DF2. I've got two names A and B
[228:37] uh with marks set as 90 80 and 1817. In
[228:40] the other one I've got age of these two
[228:42] students A and C as 17 and 18. So I can
[228:46] do merge operation. So this is my data
[228:50] frame on the left side, data frame on
[228:51] the right side. On on will use a key. On
[228:56] will use a key. So you can specify the
[229:01] column which is to be used as a key. So
[229:05] this is the key. How? So if you are
[229:08] familiar with SQL, you might be already
[229:11] knowing inner join, outer join, left
[229:14] join and right join. If you're not
[229:16] familiar, uh you can go ahead and read
[229:19] about these kind of joins on our website
[229:23] analytics.com.
[229:24] There are lot of blogs which explain the
[229:26] concept of SQL joins. Okay. So here I'm
[229:29] using the inner join which will match
[229:31] the keys in both the data frames. So
[229:35] here the keys are AB here the keys are
[229:38] AC. So which key is common in both A.
[229:41] And that is the reason I get only A
[229:43] here. So the key which is common in both
[229:45] will appear. That is the meaning of
[229:47] inner join. Okay. Outer join will have
[229:49] the keys from both the left and the
[229:51] right data frames. So I'll get uh A B as
[229:54] well as C.
[230:00] Yep. So outer join will give you all
[230:02] three. And if you notice here in the
[230:05] case of B I don't have the age values
[230:08] and in the case of C I don't have the uh
[230:11] marks okay because in your marks data
[230:13] frame there was no C and in your age
[230:16] data frame there was no B okay that is
[230:19] why we have the missing values of marks
[230:21] for C and missing value of age for B.
[230:25] Right? A was present in both the data
[230:28] frames. So both marks and age were
[230:31] updated accordingly.
[230:33] You can also do a simple concatenation
[230:35] of your data frames back to back. Okay.
[230:38] So in this case I created another data
[230:40] frame uh DF3 and this is coming from
[230:44] DF1. This is my DF1 and this is simply
[230:48] F3. So concatenation means the data
[230:51] frames will be just concatenated one
[230:53] below the other. Why one below the
[230:55] other? Because by default the axis is
