[135:03] conditions I'm applying. This is a and
[135:06] condition. Okay. So again the same
[135:08] boolean mask created and I'm able to
[135:11] retrive the numbers greater than two and
[135:13] less than 8. Make sense? Now let's see
[135:15] how can we manipulate the shapes of the
[135:19] numpy arrays. Okay. So let me create a
[135:22] numpy array here. I'm using the arrange
[135:24] function. So it will give me a
[135:26] one-dimensional array with the numbers 1
[135:28] to 12. Okay. And that one-dimensional
[135:30] array I'm going to reshape it into
[135:33] two-dimensional array by taking three
[135:36] rows and four columns. Okay. So I'll re
[135:39] reshape. So I'll reshape array of one
[135:42] dimension into a two dimension. Let's
[135:44] see. Yeah. So this is what I get. So if
[135:46] you want to print this matrix here.
[135:49] Yeah. So this is 1D and that got
[135:52] reshaped into 2D. One thing you have to
[135:54] note here is you cannot provide any
[135:56] random number here. Okay. So the product
[135:58] of these two numbers must be equal to
[136:00] the total number of elements present in
[136:02] the array that you want to reshape. So
[136:05] here the array that I'm taking is a
[136:06] matrix. Whether it is array or a matrix
[136:08] doesn't matter. But the product of these
[136:10] two numbers must be equal to the total
[136:13] number of elements present in this
[136:15] matrix. So this matrix already has 12
[136:18] elements and 3 + 4 or 3 into 4 is
[136:20] already 12. So that works. If I try this
[136:23] by making it six, I'll get an error
[136:26] because again the same error message 3
[136:28] into 6 is 18 and that cannot be fit into
[136:33] 12 positions. Super. Yeah. So you can
[136:36] also reshape into 2 + 6. So two rows,
[136:38] six columns. What does this do? This
[136:40] will take a two-dimensional matrix and
[136:43] flatten it. So flattening is exactly the
[136:46] reverse operation that we did here. So
[136:48] flattening means take all the elements
[136:50] of the 2D array and put it in one
[136:53] dimension. So you can see that this
[136:55] matrix was reshaped to 2 + 6 that is two
[136:58] rows and six columns and now it has been
[137:00] flattened back to 1D. Okay. So this is
[137:03] the original matrix and this is the
[137:05] raveled matrix. Okay fine. So I'm just
