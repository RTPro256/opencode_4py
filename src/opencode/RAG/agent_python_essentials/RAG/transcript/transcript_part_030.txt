[64:31] If the password doesn't match then uh
[64:33] the else condition will be executed
[64:36] which will notify the user that the
[64:39] password entered is wrong and
[64:41] automatically continue for the next
[64:44] iteration. Yeah, make sense. So let me
[64:47] execute this. So enter a password. So I
[64:50] am writing 1 2 3 4 5 this.
[64:55] So again this is wrong.
[64:59] So I have to enter A B C D which is also
[65:03] wrong. So now only one trial is left.
[65:06] Okay. So
[65:09] let me try hello. So in all the four
[65:12] iterations I gave the wrong password.
[65:14] Okay. So four iterations were set here.
[65:17] So all the four iterations are done. It
[65:20] just prints wrong passwords and the for
[65:22] loop is finished. Now let me execute
[65:26] this again with the correct password.
[65:29] This time it tells me welcome to the
[65:31] Python course. So here the password
[65:33] entered is correct. So it breaks out of
[65:35] the loop and no more iterations are
[65:38] done. Okay. So two iterations were
[65:40] remaining. The first iteration I gave
[65:42] this. Second iteration I gave this. So
[65:43] two more iterations were remaining but
[65:45] it break out of the for loop. Now let's
[65:48] see the continue statement. This gives
[65:50] you an option to skip a part of the loop
[65:53] when some condition is triggered. Okay,
[65:55] let's see. So again, I have my numbers
[65:59] initially set to zero. I'm going to have
[66:01] 10 iterations from 0 to 9. And if the
[66:04] number is five, skip that number. So
[66:07] continue means skip this execution and
[66:11] continue to the next iteration. Okay,
[66:12] that's what it says. So as similar to
[66:16] the break statement any statement which
[66:20] comes below continue and the part of the
[66:23] for loop or while loop will not be
[66:25] executed. So the iterations will
[66:27] continue from this point. The control
[66:29] will go from here back to the first
[66:32] line. Okay. So this line which comes
[66:35] below continue will not get executed but
[66:38] the iterations continue. Okay. That's
[66:40] exactly what a continue statement says.
[66:42] It says that continue to the next
[66:44] iteration there itself. Okay, do not
