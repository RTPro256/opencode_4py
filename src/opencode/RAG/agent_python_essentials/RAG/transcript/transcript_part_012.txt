[24:24] So for example, one variable is not
[24:26] valid but variable one is perfectly
[24:29] fine. So let's see and then finally you
[24:32] cannot also use keywords as variable
[24:36] names because keywords are reserved. So
[24:38] if you try to assign any value to any of
[24:41] these keywords, Python will throw you an
[24:43] error. So here I've defined uh let's say
[24:46] a equal to 400 and small a as 400 and
[24:52] capital a as four. Let's see what
[24:54] happens. So you can see that small a
[24:56] still points to 400 and capital a points
[24:59] to four. So some of the rules let's
[25:02] verify them quickly. So underscore a is
[25:05] valid. Okay. But if you say a underscore
[25:09] that is also valid. Okay. Because
[25:11] underscores are acceptable. But if you
[25:13] have any other special characters either
[25:15] at the start or at the end that will be
[25:17] invalid. Okay, you can see that's an
[25:21] error message saying the syntax error.
[25:23] Same syntax error you will get when you
[25:25] try to define 1 a as five. If you try to
[25:29] assign a1 as five or 500 whatever that
[25:33] number is that is perfectly fine. So now
[25:36] we'll move on to the section of uh data
[25:39] types. Let's create some of the
[25:41] variables from different data types.
[25:43] Here I'm creating a as a integer. We can
[25:46] check the data type by using the type
[25:48] function. Type is a built-in Python
[25:50] function which is used to check the data
[25:52] type of any Python object. So you can
[25:54] see that uh the data type assigned to A
[25:56] is a integer.
[26:01] Similarly, let me create a string data
[26:03] type. So B is uh luxe. So you can very
[26:08] well see that uh the strings are created
[26:10] by using double quotes. You can also
[26:12] create string by using single quotes. So
[26:15] the data type of B is a string. For
[26:18] floats you can uh assign the value
[26:21] directly. Just make sure you have a
[26:22] decimal point. So here the value
[26:24] assigned to C is 5.55 and you can see
[26:27] the data type is float and boolean you
[26:30] can create either true or false. Okay.
[26:33] So you can see the data type let's say E
[26:37] s false. So D and E both are boolean.
[26:46] And if you are interested to see what
