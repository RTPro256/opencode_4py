[73:09] functions used for simple tasks. Python
[73:11] provides a number of built-in functions
[73:13] that are incredibly useful. You don't
[73:15] need to import anything to use them.
[73:18] They are ready to go. Some common
[73:20] examples include for input output
[73:22] functions like input and print. For data
[73:24] type conversions, functions like int,
[73:27] float, string, these let you convert
[73:30] between different data types.
[73:32] Mathematical functions like sum, max,
[73:35] abs. These help with basic calculations.
[73:38] For example, if you want to find out the
[73:40] largest number in a list, you can simply
[73:42] use max and then it will return some
[73:46] number. There are other very important
[73:48] functions like length, range, and type.
[73:50] Let's move on to userdefined functions.
[73:53] These are functions you can create to
[73:55] perform specific tasks in your own
[73:57] programs. To create a userdefined
[73:59] function, you use the dev keyword
[74:02] followed by the function name,
[74:04] parameters, and the code block. Let's
[74:06] say you are creating a program to greet
[74:08] a user. Just write a function and call
[74:11] the function with the username. It's
[74:13] that simple. Next, we have the lambda
[74:15] functions. Lambda functions are small
[74:18] anonymous functions that are typically
[74:20] used for simple tasks. They are defined
[74:23] using the lambda keyword and can contain
[74:26] only a single expression. Lambda
[74:28] functions are often used along with
[74:30] functions like map, filter and sorted.
[74:33] For instance, if you have a list of
[74:35] numbers and you want to filter out only
[74:37] the even ones, a lambda function can
[74:40] make that very easy. It's time to put
[74:43] what we have learned into practice.
[74:45] Let's write some functions in Python.
[74:47] Thank you for joining me in this session
[74:48] on functions in Python. I hope you now
[74:51] see how powerful and useful functions
[74:53] are for making your code more efficient
[74:56] and organized.
[74:58] Now let's have a look how do we create
[75:01] functions in Python. As already
[75:03] discussed the purpose of functions is to
[75:06] group a particular line of code or few
