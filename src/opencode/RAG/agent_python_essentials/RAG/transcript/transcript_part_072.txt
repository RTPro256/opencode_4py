[154:05] number of numbers that I'm going to
[154:06] create in this array is 100 and I'm
[154:10] computing the sign of that x values and
[154:13] saving it as y. So I have my x and y.
[154:16] You can see the y values. Let me print
[154:19] the y values here. So sin 0 is 0 and
[154:21] sine of 2 pi 2 pi is 360° that is also
[154:25] close to zero. Right? So this is
[154:28] supposed to be interpreted as zero.
[154:30] That's not a number which is a valid
[154:32] number. I would say sin 2 pi which is
[154:34] 180° mathematically, analytically any
[154:37] high school book will give you zero. So
[154:40] this is actually zero. Okay. So first we
[154:43] will see some of the basic plot types
[154:45] here. Uh we'll first start with the line
[154:49] plots then the scatter plots, bar plots,
[154:52] histogram, box plots and pie charts. So
[154:54] let's first start with the line plot.
[154:56] Okay. So first I'm creating the figure
[154:59] canvas. You can see on which this figure
[155:01] will be plotted. I'm setting the aspect
[155:03] ratio. So kind of 6 in x 4 in kind of
[155:07] I'm creating a canvas here. So the
[155:08] aspect ratio of the figure can be set
[155:10] here 4x4 6x6. These are squarish kind of
[155:14] shapes and this will be more like a
[155:16] rectangular shape in which the plot
[155:19] would be visible. So to create the line
[155:21] plot I have the plot function. You'll
[155:23] have to provide the values in the x-axis
[155:26] then the values in the y-axis. These are
[155:28] two positional arguments and then you
[155:30] have all series of keyword arguments. So
[155:32] what kind of label you want to give to
[155:34] that plot in the legend? So this label
[155:36] will come in the legend. What should be
[155:38] the color of the line? Okay, by default
[155:40] it will have some sort of a blue color.
[155:42] But if you want to explicitly mention
[155:45] the color, we'll see how we can change
[155:47] the colors. And then the line style. So
[155:49] line style is a dash here. Dash means
[155:52] you'll get a solid line. And the width
[155:54] of the line is given as two pixels here.
[155:57] Okay. So you can change the line width.
[155:59] Okay. So default is one. Here the line
[156:01] style is dash by default anyway. Color
[156:04] is some sort of a blue not the exact
[156:06] blue that you'll get to see here. And by
