[19:47] declaring and assigning some variables
[19:49] in Jupiter notebook. So let us first
[19:52] start the Jupyter notebook. I will
[19:54] search for Jupyter notebook.
[19:58] So run this Jupyter notebook app.
[20:01] Uh once it is started, it will open in a
[20:03] new browser window whichever is your
[20:06] default browser. So you'll have access
[20:08] to all these folders. This is typically
[20:10] present within your C uh users. So these
[20:15] are all the folders which are present
[20:16] within the C users directory. You can
[20:19] browse all your files from desktop,
[20:20] documents, downloads and so on. Now only
[20:23] problem is my code files which I have
[20:26] downloaded for this particular uh module
[20:29] are in the D drive AI agent and code
[20:33] files. So first we will have to actually
[20:37] browse and change the directory to this
[20:40] one.
[20:42] Okay.
[20:43] So for this we'll close this and start
[20:47] with Anaconda prompt. Make sure you are
[20:50] selecting the Anaconda prompt.
[20:53] Now this is different from your normal
[20:55] command prompt. How your Anaconda prompt
[20:59] will have this base written. normal
[21:02] command prompt will not have that base.
[21:04] Okay, close this. Now since my folders
[21:08] are in D drive, I'll directly go to D
[21:10] drive first and from there I can
[21:13] actually start my Jupiter
[21:16] notebook. If you do not do this, you
[21:18] will not be able to access D drive
[21:21] files. You will only be able to access
[21:23] the files which are present within C
[21:25] users and whatever the username. Press
[21:28] enter. And uh this might take some
[21:31] seconds to open.
[21:36] Okay. So interface is still the same.
[21:38] It's just that the
[21:41] technique that I've used is slightly
[21:44] different so that I get access to the
[21:47] actual code files which I have saved in
[21:50] my desired directory. So you can see uh
[21:52] these are the folders present within the
[21:55] D drive. So this is where my AI agent
[21:58] code files are. Okay. So now you can see
[22:00] all the Jupyter notebooks for this
[22:02] particular module. I'll double click on
