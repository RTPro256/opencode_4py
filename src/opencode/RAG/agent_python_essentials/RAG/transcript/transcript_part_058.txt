[124:08] also take some of the functions from
[124:10] linear algebra and the random modules.
[124:12] So let's get started. So first we will
[124:15] need to import numpy. Numpai typically
[124:18] comes pre-installed in any anaconda
[124:21] installation whether you are running the
[124:23] Jupyter notebook in collab numpy comes
[124:26] pre-installed so you don't have to
[124:28] really bother about installing numpy so
[124:31] let's import numpy as an alias np and
[124:35] for reproducibility especially while
[124:38] working with random numbers I'm using a
[124:40] default seed of 42 the numpy version
[124:42] that I'm running in this notebook is
[124:44] 1.26.4 four. Okay, let's see some of the
[124:47] array creation functions. So, we'll be
[124:50] using the nparray function primarily for
[124:52] creating the arrays. Along with that, we
[124:55] can use zeros, ones, arrange, and
[124:56] lindspace functions. Let's see each one
[124:59] of them one by one. So, here I've got a
[125:01] list of numbers 1 2 3 4 5. This is a
[125:05] normal Python list. I'm going to convert
[125:07] this normal Python list into a numpy
[125:09] array. Okay, by using the np array
[125:12] function. So this is kind of type
[125:14] casting a Python list into a numpy array
[125:17] object. We can verify this by using the
[125:20] type function. You can see the data type
[125:22] is numpy. ND array. So it's a numpy n
[125:26] dimensional array object. It's no longer
[125:28] a list. Right? So now let me create a
[125:30] two-dimensional array of zeros this
[125:33] time. Okay. So I'll be using the
[125:35] np.zeros function where it will have two
[125:38] rows and three columns all filled with
[125:40] zeros. So these are the two rows one and
[125:43] two and three columns. Similarly, I can
[125:46] create another two-dimensional object by
[125:50] using the np do once function. So again,
[125:52] this is going to be two rows and three
[125:53] columns. Okay, all filled with ones. And
[125:58] you can also check the dimensionality by
[126:00] using the function. So let's see array
[126:05] ones dot shape. So you can see that it
[126:09] is having two rows and three columns. So
[126:11] there is another function to check the
[126:13] dimensionality. So that is n dim. You
[126:17] can see the dimensionality is displayed
[126:19] to be two. So you can check the nim
