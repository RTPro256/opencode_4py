[199:56] once again. So this is my data frame.
[199:59] I'm going to add another column here by
[200:02] doubling the marks. Okay, let's see. So
[200:06] I have fetched my marks column and
[200:08] multiplied that by two and saved the
[200:10] value in another column name. Now since
[200:14] this column name does not exist, it will
[200:16] be created. So you can see the new
[200:18] column name is double marks and it is
[200:21] basically the double of the original
[200:22] marks. You can also use some lambda
[200:25] functions and apply function to update
[200:27] the values. So for example, let's say I
[200:30] want to give five bonus marks to all the
[200:33] students. Okay. So I have added five
[200:36] marks into the original marks for each
[200:40] student. That's what this lambda
[200:41] function does. So the values of x is
[200:44] fetched from the marks column because
[200:47] you are applying that lambda function on
[200:48] the marks column and each value of x
[200:51] will be added to five and that resultant
[200:54] value will be replaced back into the
[200:58] marks column. You can also rename
[201:00] columns. So now since I have already
[201:02] updated my marks, it's good idea to
[201:04] update the marks column to updated
[201:06] marks. So now you can see your marks
[201:08] column is no longer marks. It is updated
[201:11] marks. And uh let's say you think now
[201:14] that this double marks column is no
[201:16] longer needed. You want to drop it or
[201:18] you want to delete it. So how do I
[201:20] delete? So you can use the drop method.
[201:22] Okay. So the drop method can actually be
[201:25] used to drop both rows and columns.
[201:28] Okay. So this is the list of labels
[201:33] either the row labels or column labels
[201:35] which you want to drop. So if you want
[201:37] to drop multiple columns then this will
[201:39] be a list of multiple column labels. So
[201:42] these are my labels. Okay, these are my
[201:44] labels. Axis equal to one means
[201:49] drop columns
[201:50] and axis equal to zero means drop rows.
[201:54] So essentially whatever list of labels
[201:57] you are providing Python will think that
[202:00] these are the labels for the rows if you
[202:03] make access equal to zero which is
[202:04] anyway the default. So if you do not
