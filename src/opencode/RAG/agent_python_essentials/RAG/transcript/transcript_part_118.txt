[254:32] We'll start with an introduction to file
[254:34] handling in Python focusing on CSV and
[254:37] JSON files and then we'll provide code
[254:40] examples to illustrate how to read and
[254:43] write these file types. So why do we
[254:45] need to work with files? Data storage
[254:47] and exchange is one of the most common
[254:50] uses. Files particularly in formats like
[254:54] CSV and JSON makes it easy to store,
[254:56] share and exchange data between
[254:58] different systems and applications. CSV
[255:01] files are used for tabular data while
[255:03] JSON files are widely used for
[255:06] structured data exchange between APIs.
[255:09] Additionally, files are often used in
[255:11] data prep-processing to prepare data for
[255:14] AI models and analytics. They provide an
[255:17] easy readable way to log, store, and
[255:21] transfer the information needed for our
[255:23] machine learning workflows. Python
[255:25] provides built-in modules like CSV and
[255:27] JSON to handle CSV and JSON files
[255:30] easily. Additionally, third party
[255:32] libraries like pandas offer powerful
[255:35] data manipulation capabilities, making
[255:38] it easier to pre-process data for AI
[255:41] applications. CSV files are commonly
[255:43] used for storing tablet data like
[255:45] spreadsheets or simple databases.
[255:48] Python's CSV module allows you to read
[255:50] these files using the CSV reader
[255:53] function and write them using CSV.riter
[255:57] function. The CSV reader function reads
[256:00] each line of the CSV file and returns it
[256:03] as a list. Similarly, CSV.writer
[256:06] function lets you write rows of data
[256:10] back into a CSV format. This module is
[256:13] perfect for small to medium-sized data
[256:16] sets and for those who want to work with
[256:18] CSVs without needing advanced data
[256:21] manipulation. However, for large data
[256:23] sets or when you need advanced data
[256:26] manipulation, pandas is a better choice.
[256:28] It allows you to read CSV files into
[256:30] data frames which are powerful data
[256:33] structures for data analysis and
[256:35] pre-processing. Here's an example of how
[256:38] to read and write CSV files using
[256:41] pandas. First, we import pandas and use
[256:45] pdread CSV function to read the data
