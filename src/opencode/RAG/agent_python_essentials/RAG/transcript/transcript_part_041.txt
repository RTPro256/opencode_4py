[88:19] outside the function. Okay, so the
[88:21] function can have right now the readonly
[88:24] access as in this case you can see it
[88:26] had a readonly access but let's say you
[88:29] want to change or update the value of
[88:32] the global variables. Basically you want
[88:34] to have a write access also to the
[88:36] global variables. For that you need to
[88:39] define that variable which you want to
[88:41] provide this function as a read write
[88:43] access. Okay. So that should be defined
[88:46] within the functions space or the local
[88:50] uh variable space as a global. So this
[88:53] global keyword enables this function to
[88:57] have a read write access to this global
[89:00] variable. Now, so this name will be
[89:02] modified by this function. So I'm
[89:05] modifying the value here. And when I
[89:07] call that function, you can see the
[89:09] value of the name has changed. So this
[89:12] was defined out of the function. And
[89:14] within the function, the value was
[89:15] changed. And now I'm accessing the value
[89:18] of the variable out of the function. And
[89:20] it still gives me the value which was
[89:22] defined within the function. So that is
[89:26] how you can create a global variable
[89:29] which can be shared by even multiple
[89:31] functions. So each function can still
[89:34] share the same value in a readr write
[89:37] access mode provided that you provide
[89:40] the variable with a global keyword in
[89:44] all those functions where you want to
[89:45] share in a readr mode.
[89:49] Welcome to this session on modules and
[89:51] packages in Python. Modules and packages
[89:53] are incredibly useful tools that help us
[89:57] keep our code organized, reusable, and
[89:59] easy to manage. Today, we'll explore
[90:01] what they are, how to create them, and
[90:04] why are they important for any
[90:05] programmer, especially as your projects
[90:07] grow. Let's dive in. Let's begin by
[90:10] understanding modules in Python. Simply
[90:12] put, a module is a file containing
[90:14] Python code, typically functions and
[90:16] class definitions, which we can reuse
[90:19] across different programs. It helps us
[90:21] organize related code in a logical way.
