[10:57] that. Uh you can also check this to
[11:00] start with Python 3 as your preferred or
[11:03] the default kernel. So kernel is the
[11:05] program which interprets your Python
[11:07] code and executes it. You can resize
[11:11] these windows. So this is how your uh
[11:14] coding window looks like. This is my
[11:15] coding window. And on the left side I
[11:17] have again my file browser window. Here
[11:20] you can type your Python codes. My first
[11:23] Python program let's say print hello
[11:25] world. And to execute this you can do a
[11:29] shift enter or control enter. You can
[11:31] also click on this button to execute
[11:34] this cell. Okay. So codes are written in
[11:37] code cells. This is one code cell
[11:39] whichever is highlighted in blue uh
[11:41] boundary. So that's a code cell. You can
[11:44] see that this is currently in the code
[11:46] mode. So you can also change the mode of
[11:48] the cell. So this is currently in the
[11:50] code. So I'll click on this. This will
[11:53] execute the cell. So once the cell is
[11:55] executed, the output of the cell is
[11:58] displayed just below the cell. So this
[12:00] is one way you can execute the cell.
[12:02] Otherwise, if you want to do it from
[12:04] your keyboard, you can do a shift enter
[12:06] or control enter. Shift enter will
[12:08] execute the current cell and advance to
[12:11] the next cell. Control enter will
[12:13] execute the current cell and stay there.
[12:15] Now let's have a look into another
[12:17] coding environment which does not
[12:18] require any installation and can be
[12:20] accessed from anywhere in the world and
[12:22] that is Google's collab. So that also
[12:24] opens in another browser window. But you
[12:27] need to first sign in into your Google
[12:28] account.
[12:30] So we'll go to Google and uh search for
[12:33] Google Collab
[12:35] and here in the first link click on
[12:38] that. So assuming that you are already
[12:40] signed into your Google account this is
[12:42] the window that should appear. If you
[12:44] have already previously opened any
[12:46] Google Collab notebooks that will also
[12:49] be displayed. So on the left side you
[12:52] can see there is a menu table of
