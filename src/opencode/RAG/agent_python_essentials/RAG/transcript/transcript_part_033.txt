[71:05] to maintain. By the end of this session,
[71:07] you will be comfortable defining your
[71:09] own functions, using built-in ones, and
[71:12] even working with Lambda functions.
[71:14] Let's get started. So, why are functions
[71:16] important? Imagine you had to bake
[71:19] cookies and every time you did it, you
[71:22] had to measure all the ingredients from
[71:24] scratch. Instead, wouldn't it be easier
[71:27] to just have a recipe? Functions are
[71:29] like recipes in programming. They let
[71:31] you write code for a specific task once
[71:34] and then reuse it wherever you want.
[71:37] This saves you time and also helps to
[71:40] avoid mistakes. Let's look at a
[71:41] scenario. Say Anna wants to send a
[71:44] personalized greeting message to a list
[71:47] of 50 people. She needs to make sure
[71:49] that each message is consistent except
[71:52] for the name of the recipient. One
[71:54] approach is to write out the message for
[71:57] each person, but that's a lot of
[72:00] repetitive work and it's easy to make
[72:02] mistakes. Instead, we can use a function
[72:05] to handle this task. By defining a
[72:07] greeting function, Anna can simply call
[72:10] the function for each recipient and
[72:13] personalize the message automatically.
[72:15] This makes the code much more efficient
[72:17] and prevents mistakes. Let's break down
[72:20] what a function is. In Python, a
[72:22] function is a block of code that
[72:24] performs a specific task. You define a
[72:26] function by using the def keyword
[72:28] followed by a function name, input
[72:30] parameters, and the code that should run
[72:34] inside the function. Here's a simple
[72:36] example. Let's define a function called
[72:38] greet that takes a name as a parameter
[72:41] and prints a greeting. In this example,
[72:44] greet Anna will print hello Anna, how
[72:48] are you today? Once defined, we can call
[72:50] this function as many times as we need,
[72:52] saving us from typing out the greeting
[72:54] each time. Python offers several types
[72:57] of functions. For example, built-in
[72:59] functions like print, length, and sum.
[73:01] Userdefined functions which you can
[73:03] create yourself for custom tasks. Lambda
[73:07] functions which are small oneline
