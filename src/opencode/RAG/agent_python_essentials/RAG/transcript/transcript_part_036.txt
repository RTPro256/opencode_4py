[77:33] variable. So the output of the print is
[77:36] executed and the output is also stored.
[77:38] So whatever the function returns in this
[77:41] case it is returning the total that
[77:43] returned value is stored in the output
[77:45] variable here. Now in the previous case
[77:49] the function did not have the return
[77:50] statement. So the function was not
[77:52] returning anything. So nothing was saved
[77:55] here. And now here the output value of
[77:57] the total is returned. So that returned
[78:00] value is saved and that is what we are
[78:02] able to retrieve. Till now we created
[78:05] two functions which did not need any
[78:09] input parameter to execute. Now I am
[78:13] rewriting that function which will take
[78:16] the name of the user as the input
[78:18] parameter and use that name to construct
[78:21] this string and this will be returned by
[78:25] the function. So let me try with my
[78:27] name. It says welcome to Python course
[78:29] prashant. So this string was
[78:33] concatenated to the original string and
[78:36] the end you can see there is a white
[78:37] space. So this is name is essentially a
[78:40] string and this plus sign is basically
[78:43] doing a string concatenation. Okay, that
[78:46] concatenated string is finally returned
[78:48] by the function. You can actually save
[78:51] the output and verify. Okay, so output
[78:56] equal to
[78:58] welcome
[79:00] let's say Harry this time.
[79:04] Let me save.
[79:06] And uh output is
[79:10] retrieved here.
[79:12] Perfect. Now you can also specify the
[79:16] default values of the input parameters.
[79:19] Okay. So here in this case the name has
[79:23] got a default value of. Okay. So you can
[79:27] see if you provide the name of the input
[79:30] argument that will overwrite the default
[79:33] value. The advantage of the default
[79:35] value is if you forgot to provide any
[79:38] input parameter to the function while
[79:41] calling the function the default value
[79:43] would be used. Okay. So let's see. So it
[79:46] still says otherwise without providing
[79:48] the default value this empty function
[79:51] call would have returned you an error.
