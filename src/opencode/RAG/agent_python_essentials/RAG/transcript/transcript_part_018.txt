[38:01] pseudo code represents the thought
[38:04] process behind the decision making.
[38:06] Using such simple pseudo code helps us
[38:08] think about the logic before jumping
[38:10] into the actual Python code, making it
[38:12] easier to plan out what we need our
[38:15] program to do. Let's look at the actual
[38:17] Python syntax. For a single condition,
[38:19] we use the if keyword followed by a
[38:22] colon. The code block that runs the if
[38:25] condition is true is indented right
[38:28] underneath. For example, if you have a
[38:30] variable x and you want to check if it
[38:33] is positive, you would write if x
[38:36] greater than zero colon followed by a
[38:38] indentation of four white spaces print
[38:41] positive. So, Python syntax is very
[38:44] simple and easy to follow. Just remember
[38:46] indentation is the key. When we have
[38:48] multiple conditions, you can use l if
[38:50] and else. Here's a simple example. Let's
[38:53] say you have a variable X. If X is
[38:55] greater than zero, you would print
[38:57] positive. If X equals to 0, you would
[39:00] print zero. Otherwise, you would print
[39:03] negative. Using if, L, if else helps us
[39:06] make our code readable and logically
[39:08] organized. It allows us to handle
[39:10] multiple possibilities efficiently
[39:13] rather than using lots of separate if
[39:16] statements. Now, it's time for some
[39:18] hands-on practice. Let's open up our
[39:20] Python environment and try writing some
[39:23] conditional statements. Before we wrap
[39:25] up, let's talk about some best
[39:27] practices. First, always try to write
[39:29] clear conditions that are easy to
[39:32] understand. Proper indentation is
[39:34] critical in Python. It defines which
[39:36] code belongs to which condition. Try to
[39:38] avoid deep nesting of conditions
[39:40] whenever possible as it can make your
[39:43] code hard to read. Instead, use logical
[39:46] operators or refactor the code. Lastly,
[39:49] remember to use comments to explain any
[39:53] complex condition. This will help anyone
[39:55] reading your code, including your future
[39:58] self. Following these best practices
[40:00] will help make your code more
[40:02] maintainable and easier for others to
