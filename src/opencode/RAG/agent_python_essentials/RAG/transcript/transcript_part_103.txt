[222:11] So you can also extract columns dates
[222:15] months uh week of the year date of the
[222:20] year month of the year quarter
[222:22] information. So you can extract all
[222:24] these information from a datetime
[222:26] column.
[222:29] You can also reset the index. So let's
[222:30] say you want to get your names column
[222:32] back. Okay, so you have got your names
[222:34] column back. Okay, in place equal to
[222:36] true means that resetting of the index
[222:38] is done permanently. So your data frame
[222:40] has changed once again permanently. This
[222:42] has gone back to the original. Now this
[222:44] time I'm creating couple of nan values
[222:47] or missing values in my data frame. So
[222:49] some of the values see the fourth row
[222:52] essentially the fifth row index four. So
[222:54] this is the row where it will make a
[222:56] change and minus one means the last row.
[222:59] Now the columns 0 1 2. So essentially
[223:03] and this is the place where it will be
[223:05] replaced with null value also referred
[223:08] as nan. Nan is not a number essentially
[223:10] a null value. So these two are going to
[223:13] replace these two positions. Okay let's
[223:16] have a look. Perfect. So this is one nan
[223:18] here another nan here. Okay, another
[223:20] thing that you might have noticed is the
[223:23] original data frame had the age values
[223:25] as a integer. The data type here was a
[223:27] integer. The moment we have these
[223:30] missing values as nan, the data type has
[223:33] changed. You can see that decimal point
[223:35] coming up. So this is no longer integer,
[223:37] it is actually in the float data type
[223:40] now. Okay, this is in a float data type.
[223:43] So you can verify that by using the
[223:45] info.
[223:48] So your age is no longer a integer. It
[223:50] is float 64-bit precision. Okay. So you
[223:54] want to know how many missing values are
[223:56] there. So these are the positions where
[223:59] the missing values are present. That is
[224:01] marked with true. So true shows that
[224:05] these positions are missing values. So
[224:08] counting how many missing values by each
[224:11] column. So name column does not have any
[224:14] missing value. Gender also does not have
[224:16] any missing value. Age column has got
