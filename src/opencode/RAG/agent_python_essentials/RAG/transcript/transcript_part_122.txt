[263:44] database, you can close the connection.
[263:46] It's a good programming practice to
[263:49] close the connection. So that database
[263:51] is released from the memory. Okay? And
[263:54] also close the connection. So it's no
[263:56] longer occupying any memory in your
[263:59] Python. Perfect. So next we are going to
[264:02] connect a MySQL database with Python. Uh
[264:06] for this we'll be installing PI MySQL
[264:09] and MySQL connector. So these are the
[264:12] two connectors most popular connectors
[264:14] available to connect a MySQL database to
[264:17] Python. Okay. So once the installations
[264:19] are done, let's first use the PI MySQL
[264:23] connector and connect with Python. So
[264:26] import the Py MySQL library. And here is
[264:30] the database configuration. Right now my
[264:32] database is present in AWS RDS. It's a
[264:36] RDS instance. Uh this is the default
[264:39] port used by the MySQL databases on AWS
[264:43] RDS. RDS is relational database services
[264:47] from AWS. There is a admin username for
[264:52] each database. There is a password for
[264:55] that admin user and there is a database
[264:59] name. So make sure you have all the
[265:01] details before proceeding. This can very
[265:05] well be a database hosted on your local
[265:08] machine. So if you install uh MySQL
[265:12] studio, you will be able to create a
[265:14] database in your local machine as well.
[265:16] In that case, the host will be replaced
[265:18] with your local machine's URL. So port
[265:22] more or less would remain the same and
[265:24] the other details just fill in as it is
[265:28] needed. One strong suggestion here is we
[265:33] should not be hard coding these details
[265:36] in Python notebook. It is not a good
[265:38] programming practice. Ideally, we should
[265:41] be using environment variables to store
[265:45] these sensitive information because if
[265:48] you have or rather if you share this
[265:51] Python notebook with anyone else with
[265:54] all these details filled in, they would
[265:57] be able to access your database and make
[266:00] irreparable changes to your database.
[266:03] They can literally add anything or
[266:05] delete anything from your database.
[266:07] Right? So this is not a good programming
[266:09] practice to have these details right
[266:11] inside your notebook. Okay. Later in the
