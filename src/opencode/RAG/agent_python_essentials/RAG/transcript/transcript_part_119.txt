[256:49] from data.csv into a data frame. We can
[256:52] then display the first few rows using
[256:56] df.head function. After performing some
[256:58] data manipulation such as calculating a
[257:01] new total column, we can write the data
[257:04] frame to a new CSV file using dataf
[257:07] frame.2
[257:09] CSV function. Settings index equal to
[257:11] false prevents pandas from writing the
[257:14] rows indices into the file. Reading and
[257:16] writing JSON files with Python. The JSON
[257:18] module is a part of Python's standard
[257:20] library and provides methods for reading
[257:23] and writing JSON data. The JSON objects
[257:26] are similar to Python dictionaries
[257:28] making it straightforward to work with
[257:30] them. You can use JSON.load function to
[257:33] read JSON data from a file into a Python
[257:36] dictionary. Conversely, JSON.dump
[257:39] function allows you to write a
[257:42] dictionary into a JSON file. For
[257:44] handling JSON data in string format, you
[257:46] can use JSON.loads function and
[257:49] JSON.dumps function. Working with JSON
[257:52] files using JSON module. In this
[257:54] example, we read data from data.json
[257:57] using JSON.load function which loads the
[258:00] JSON content into a Python dictionary.
[258:02] We can then access elements of the data
[258:04] structure using data employees. After
[258:07] modifying the data, adding a new
[258:09] employee in this case, we write the
[258:11] updated dictionary back to the file
[258:13] using JSON.dump. The index equal to 4
[258:15] parameter formats the JSON file with
[258:18] indentation for better readability. In
[258:21] conclusion, handling files like CSV and
[258:24] JSON in Python is straightforward with
[258:26] the standard libraries and enhanced by
[258:28] tools like pandas. I hope this session
[258:31] has provided you with valuable insights
[258:33] into working with files and databases in
[258:35] Python.
[258:37] So in this coding tutorial, we'll see
[258:39] how to connect with SQL databases using
[258:42] Python. First we'll start with in-memory
[258:45] databases which are created using SQLite
[258:49] package
[258:50] and then we will connect with one MySQL
[258:54] database and another one which is a
