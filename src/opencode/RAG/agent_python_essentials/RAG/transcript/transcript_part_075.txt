[160:34] if you have multiple plots, make sure
[160:35] that each of those plots have a label
[160:38] because you are not explicitly providing
[160:40] any text within the legend function
[160:42] here. Okay. So it's advised that each of
[160:44] the plot must have a corresponding label
[160:47] so that mattplot li is able to recognize
[160:50] what should be the labels for each of
[160:52] these plots if you have multiple plots
[160:54] in the same canvas. Okay. So let's say I
[160:57] want to shift the lo uh location from
[161:00] first quadrant, this is my first
[161:01] quadrant to let's say the third
[161:02] quadrant. This is the second quadrant.
[161:04] This is the third quadrant. So what I'll
[161:06] do is loc OC equal to 3. So that will
[161:10] change the location to the third
[161:11] quadrant. Now you can see the location
[161:13] shifted from the default of first to
[161:15] third. So mattplot li actually selects
[161:18] the best location so that it does not
[161:21] overlap with the plot. So that
[161:23] intelligence is there with mattplot li.
[161:25] Okay. So it already takes care of that.
[161:28] But still in some case if you want to
[161:30] specify what should be the location you
[161:33] can go ahead and do that. Okay. You can
[161:34] provide numbers or you can provide text
[161:37] as well. Okay. So the location can be
[161:40] provided as a text. You can see it
[161:42] supports these strings upper left, upper
[161:44] right, lower left and lower right. And
[161:47] it is also supporting the center. So by
[161:50] default it will take the best place.
[161:52] Okay. So that it does not overlap with
[161:55] your actual plots. Fine. So let's go
[161:57] ahead. Now this time again I'm having a
[161:59] biariate plot. Let me create two set of
[162:02] random numbers here X and Y and again
[162:05] creating the figure canvas providing the
[162:08] X values and the Y values to the scatter
[162:10] function. And then what should be the
[162:13] color C equal to means the color. So
[162:15] short form of color is C. So what should
[162:18] be the color of the marker? What should
[162:19] be the marker style? Okay. And what
[162:22] should be the opacity level of these
[162:25] markers? So let's see the plot first. So
[162:27] you can see you have the red color
[162:29] markers here. If I set alpha as one,
