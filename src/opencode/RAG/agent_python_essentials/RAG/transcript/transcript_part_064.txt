[137:08] printing the original matrix so that I
[137:09] can do the transpose operation. So what
[137:11] does the transpose do? So it will
[137:13] exchange the rows with columns. So
[137:16] essentially the first row becomes the
[137:18] first column. The second row becomes the
[137:20] second column. Third row becomes the
[137:22] third column. So we had three rows. In
[137:25] the transposed matrix we'll have three
[137:27] columns. Okay. Exactly. So you can see
[137:30] the first column was the first row.
[137:31] Second column is the second row and the
[137:35] third column was the third row
[137:36] originally. Okay. So rows and columns
[137:38] are just flipped. Let's see the data
[137:40] types and how we work with data types in
[137:43] numpy.
[137:44] So again I'm creating a numpy array with
[137:46] the numbers 1.2 3.14 and 5.6. You can
[137:50] see that these are floatingoint numbers.
[137:53] Okay. And let me just print the data
[137:55] type. So it says float 64. Essentially
[137:58] I'm fetching the data type of the
[138:00] elements present in my array. This as
[138:03] type method will change the data type.
[138:07] So my original elements were in float 64
[138:10] data type and now they are being type
[138:12] casted to a integer data type. So you
[138:15] can change the data type. So you are
[138:17] saying that take this array and change
[138:20] the data type to in 64 and save it back.
[138:23] Okay. So you can see that my numbers are
[138:27] 135. So the floatingoint numbers 1.2
[138:31] 3.14 and 5.6 has been converted into the
[138:34] nearest integers. Okay.
[138:37] Now there are some universal functions
[138:39] for arithmetic operations. Let's have a
[138:41] quick look. So you have the functions
[138:44] for addition, subtraction,
[138:45] multiplication and division as well. I
[138:47] have my arrays X and Y. You can use
[138:49] these functions to carry out these
[138:51] operations. And you can actually also
[138:53] carry out these operations directly. But
[138:55] you have to make sure that these two
[138:57] arrays which you want to multiply,
[138:59] divide, subtract and add, they have
[139:03] exactly the same number of elements.
[139:05] Okay, these are element wise operations.
[139:07] So x + y works, x minus y also works and
