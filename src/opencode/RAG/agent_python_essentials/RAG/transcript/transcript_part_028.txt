[60:13] so these print statement and the
[60:15] increment doesn't execute. Let's see
[60:18] nothing happened. I am not getting any
[60:20] output print here. Okay. Now let me go
[60:23] back to one and execute this once again.
[60:26] So the number in the first iteration was
[60:28] one. It is less than seven. So it
[60:31] entered the while loop. It prints the
[60:33] number and then increments it in the
[60:35] next line. Okay. The number gets
[60:37] incremented. So it becomes two. So in
[60:39] the next iteration this is two. Prints
[60:41] two and then it gets incremented to
[60:43] three. In the next iteration this is
[60:44] already three. So three is less than
[60:46] seven. again true. So it prints three.
[60:49] Okay. And then increments to four. Four
[60:52] is already less than seven. So it prints
[60:54] four and then it gets incremented to
[60:57] five and then to six and then to seven.
[60:59] So the moment it is incremented to
[61:01] seven. Now 7 is not less than seven. So
[61:05] what happens then? The while loop
[61:07] condition becomes false and so nothing
[61:09] gets executed. The while loop exits on
[61:12] its own gracefully. Yeah. So while loop
[61:16] will exit on its own as long as this
[61:18] condition becomes false the moment this
[61:21] condition becomes false. Okay. So here
[61:24] I'm incrementing by 22. So this will
[61:27] jump to two units. So the same thing
[61:30] it's just that the while loop terminates
[61:32] a bit faster. Now now let's say you do
[61:35] not want to continue all the iterations.
[61:37] Okay you want to jump between the
[61:39] iterations or you want to skip the
[61:41] iterations in between. Okay. Or you want
[61:44] to break out of the while loop or even
[61:47] the for loop based on some condition.
[61:50] Okay, you want to break out of the loops
[61:52] based on some condition or you want to
[61:54] jump some of the iterations. You don't
[61:57] want to complete that iteration. You
[62:00] want to continue to the next iteration
[62:03] based on some condition. This is what
[62:05] exactly we are going to see next.
[62:08] Okay. So some external factors may
[62:11] influence your programs and when this
[62:13] occurs you may want the program to exit
[62:15] the loop completely or skip a part of
