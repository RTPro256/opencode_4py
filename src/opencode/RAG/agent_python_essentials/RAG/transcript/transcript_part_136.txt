[294:49] avoid overloading the server. Exceeding
[294:52] this limit can result in errors or being
[294:54] temporarily blocked. It also ensures
[294:56] fair usage among different clients. To
[295:00] handle rate limits effectively, check
[295:02] the headers. Many APIs include rate
[295:04] limit information in the response
[295:06] headers such as the number of requests
[295:08] remaining. You can also implement
[295:10] delays. For this, you use the time
[295:12] dosleeve function to wait before making
[295:15] new requests if you are close to the
[295:17] limit. And finally, you can also use
[295:19] exponential backoff. Gradually increase
[295:21] the wait time after each retry if you
[295:25] encounter rate limit errors. It's
[295:27] crucial to respect the API's rate limit
[295:29] and monitor your application's request
[295:32] rate to avoid service disruptions.
[295:35] Authentication is essential for securing
[295:37] APIs and controlling access to
[295:39] resources. It ensures that only
[295:41] authorized users can access certain data
[295:44] or functionalities. Common
[295:46] authentication methods include API keys,
[295:49] OOTH 2.0 and beer tokens. Now let's talk
[295:53] about the authentication types one by
[295:55] one. Let's start with the API keys. API
[295:58] keys are simple yet effective methods
[296:00] for authenticating requests. After
[296:03] registering with an API provider, you
[296:05] will receive a unique key that
[296:08] identifies you. You include this key in
[296:10] your requests either in the headers or
[296:12] as a query parameter. For security, it's
[296:15] better to include it in the headers.
[296:17] Remember to keep your API keys secure.
[296:20] Do not hardcode them in your scripts or
[296:22] share them publicly. Use environment
[296:25] variables or secure storage mechanisms
[296:28] to protect them. Now, let's talk about
[296:30] the OOTH authentication, which is an
[296:33] open standard for access delegation that
[296:36] allows third party applications to
[296:39] access user data without sharing
[296:41] passwords. Platforms like Google,
[296:43] Facebook and Twitter use OOTH to provide
[296:47] secure access. The OOTH flow typically
[296:49] involves the following steps. First, the
[296:52] authentication request is generated. The
