[179:25] have here. I'm creating an annotation.
[179:28] Annotation will help to pinpoint a
[179:31] particular point in the plot and provide
[179:34] a label to it. Okay, that's the annotate
[179:36] function. So this is the value that will
[179:40] come up in the label. So this is the X
[179:42] and Y coordinate of the arrow. You are
[179:46] creating an arrow essentially and this
[179:48] is the label at the end of the arrow you
[179:50] can say. So and this is the text where
[179:53] the text starts and then the arrow
[179:56] properties what color you want and you
[179:58] want to shrink or expand what length of
[180:01] that arrow. Some of these customizations
[180:03] you can look at in the documentation.
[180:06] Now these are the other regular things.
[180:08] So you can see that I'm able to
[180:10] highlight a particular point in the plot
[180:12] by using this arrow here. So this is the
[180:15] label which I have provided in the
[180:17] annotation. Okay. You can also have a
[180:19] regular text box placed anywhere in the
[180:22] plot. Okay. So that function is
[180:23] different. So that is plt.ext function.
[180:26] Okay. So you can see the background
[180:28] colors and those things are different.
[180:30] If you want you can change the ggplot to
[180:33] let's say seaborn or bmh.
[180:37] So let's go ahead and look about the
[180:40] line stylesheets. So matt plot lib style
[180:46] sheets. Okay. So we have the stylesheets
[180:48] reference in mattplot lib here. So this
[180:51] is how we use the ggplot option and
[180:53] these are the other. So this is the
[180:55] default. This is what we have been using
[180:57] until now and then we changed it to
[180:59] ggplot. So once you have changed the
[181:01] stylesheet that stylesheet remains
[181:03] active for the remaining notebook. Okay.
[181:06] Unless you set it back to the default.
[181:09] So this is a classic one solarized light
[181:12] BMH. This is how the plots will look
[181:13] like in the BMH. You can have dark
[181:16] background, light background, 538,
[181:18] ggplot, grayscale and then you have the
[181:21] seaborn v08 version bright colorlind
[181:26] dark pallet everything. Okay. So yeah
[181:30] and so on. So let's come back. Let me
[181:32] change it to BMH and see how does the
[181:35] plot change. Yeah. So this has the
