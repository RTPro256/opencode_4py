[105:29] within your variable names using
[105:32] underscores. So if the width is 10,
[105:34] height is 20, the area of the rectangle
[105:38] would be width time height instead of
[105:41] simply writing xy and z equal to x
[105:44] multiplied by y. So this is much more
[105:46] descriptive and much more meaningful. So
[105:49] later on when you come back to your code
[105:51] by looking at this piece of code you
[105:52] instantly know what you are doing what
[105:54] calculation you are doing where exactly
[105:56] you are going to use that calculation
[105:58] function naming conventions. So all the
[106:00] function names must start with small
[106:03] case always. So and you should use again
[106:08] a snake case okay instead of using camel
[106:10] case. So camel case starts with a
[106:13] capital alphabet and in between you have
[106:16] more capital alphabets. That's what we
[106:18] call as the camel case. So camel case is
[106:20] reserved for naming classes in Python
[106:23] and not functions. For functions we
[106:25] should be using again snake case. So if
[106:28] you want to use calculate area so this
[106:30] is also not a very good function name.
[106:33] Why? Because this is again too short to
[106:37] understand what kind of calculation is
[106:39] happening. Right? If you wanted to
[106:41] calculate area write down calculate area
[106:43] and this could be simple calculator,
[106:45] income calculator. It could be MI
[106:47] calculator. It could be just any other
[106:49] random calculator. Right? So this is a
[106:52] better way of writing the function name.
[106:54] Or if you are calculating the total
[106:56] price of an item, okay, write down
[106:58] completely calculate total price and the
[107:01] function names cannot contain spaces. So
[107:03] substitute the spaces with underscores.
[107:06] Again, uh for naming the constants, try
[107:09] to use uppercase. As you would have
[107:12] already noticed in one of our first
[107:13] example, we use the discount rate in
[107:16] capitals. So if these are defined as
[107:18] constants in your notebook, try to have
[107:20] capital letters for those constants. So
[107:23] the class name should use camel case
[107:24] instead of snake case or lower case. So
[107:27] this is bad nomomenclature. So P should
[107:30] be capital here and we should also avoid
