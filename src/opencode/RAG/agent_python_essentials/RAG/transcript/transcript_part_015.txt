[31:18] So let's see some of these operators in
[31:21] action. So I'm adding a and b. Uh now
[31:25] I'm subtracting b from a. So I'm
[31:28] dividing a by b. So a is we have seen is
[31:33] 15 b is 8. So this is 15 divided by 8.
[31:37] This is 15 * 8 120. And uh this is
[31:42] exponentiation. So 2 to 2 to the^ of 3.
[31:45] Similarly you can just change this
[31:47] number. 2 ^ of 10 would be 1024. So this
[31:50] is for exponential or powers. So this is
[31:53] flow division. So this is 15 divided by
[31:56] 8. Um and you are only looking for the
[31:59] quotient part which is one and modulo
[32:03] operator will give you the remainder. So
[32:04] remainder should be seven. So when 15 is
[32:06] divided by 8 you'll get one as the
[32:08] quotient and seven as the remainder.
[32:12] Let's have a look into some of the
[32:13] comparison operators. So 2 * equality
[32:16] sign will be used to check the equality
[32:18] between two operants.
[32:21] This is for not equal to for greater
[32:23] than. This is for less than, less than
[32:25] equal to and greater than equal to. So
[32:29] I'm checking whether let's print the
[32:31] value of a and b before we go ahead. So
[32:33] a is 15 and b is 8. I'm checking whether
[32:36] a is equal to b. It says false.
[32:40] Certainly a is not equal to b because a
[32:42] is 15 and b is 8. Now I'm checking
[32:45] whether a is equal to 51 or not. So a is
[32:48] not equal to 51 because a is actually
[32:51] equal to 15. So here I am checking
[32:55] whether a is equal to b or not and
[32:58] checking the data type of the returned
[33:01] output. Here the output will be a
[33:02] boolean you can see. So for all these
[33:05] comparison operators the returned output
[33:08] will be boolean type. You can see true
[33:10] false true false. So that true false is
[33:13] basically a boolean data type. Now I'm
[33:15] checking whether a is greater than b.
[33:17] Yes indeed it is greater than b. A is
[33:20] less than B. This should return false. A
[33:23] is greater than 51. No, 15 is less than
[33:27] 51. So it is false again. Now for
[33:31] logical operators, uh and or and not. So
[33:36] is 1 equal to 1? This will return me
[33:38] true. Is 2 equal to two? Yes, this will
[33:41] also return me true. So if this is true
