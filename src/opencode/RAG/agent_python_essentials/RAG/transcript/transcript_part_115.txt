[248:17] SQLite to create a temporary database in
[248:20] RAM. In the code example, we establish a
[248:23] connection, create table, insert data,
[248:26] query it, and finally close the
[248:28] connection. All operations are performed
[248:30] in memory and no data is written to the
[248:32] disk. When to use in-memory databases?
[248:35] In-memory databases are incredibly
[248:38] useful in scenarios where speed is
[248:40] crucial because they operate in RAM.
[248:43] Read and write operations are much
[248:44] faster than disk based databases. This
[248:48] makes them ideal for applications that
[248:49] need to process data quickly. They're
[248:52] also excellent for testing and
[248:53] development. Using an in-memory database
[248:56] allows developers to run tests without
[248:58] the need to set up a test database
[249:00] environment. Each test can start with a
[249:03] clean slate ensuring test isolation and
[249:06] repeatability. Limitations of using
[249:08] in-memory databases. Volatility. Since
[249:11] the data resides in volatile memory, it
[249:13] doesn't persist after the application
[249:15] ends. This means you shouldn't use
[249:18] in-memory databases for applications
[249:19] where data persistence is required.
[249:22] Memory constraints. Additionally, they
[249:24] are constrained by the available system
[249:26] memory making them unsuitable for large
[249:29] data sets. concurrency. They may also
[249:32] have limitations in handling concurrent
[249:34] connections which can be a concern for
[249:36] multi-threaded applications.
[249:38] Understanding these trade-offs is
[249:40] essential when deciding whether to use
[249:43] an in-memory database for your project.
[249:46] To overcome these limitations of
[249:47] in-memory databases, we have persistent
[249:50] databases like MySQL, Postgress SQL,
[249:53] MongoDB, Reddis, Cassandra, etc.
[249:57] Connecting to MySQL database. Let's look
[249:59] at how to connect to a MySQL database
[250:02] using the MySQL connector Python
[250:04] library. First, we import the library.
[250:07] Then we attempt to establish a
[250:09] connection using
[250:10] MySQL.Connectctor.connect
[250:12] function providing the necessary
[250:14] parameters like host, user, password,
