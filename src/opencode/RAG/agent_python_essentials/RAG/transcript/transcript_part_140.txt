[303:25] like Postman can also be used. These
[303:27] provide a user-friendly interface for
[303:29] sending various types of HTTP requests
[303:32] and viewing the responses. So to test
[303:34] our endpoint, we can simply open a web
[303:36] browser and navigate to http localhost
[303:39] col 5000 which is the typical port
[303:43] accessed by flask applications and
[303:46] followed by a slash and then the name of
[303:48] the endpoint. The browser will display
[303:50] the JSON response from the server and
[303:53] alternatively we can use the curl
[303:54] command in the terminal to make the same
[303:57] get request. However, since browsers
[304:01] don't natively allow us to send a post
[304:04] request in a JSON body format from the
[304:07] web browsers address bar, we can use
[304:11] curl to send a post request with a JSON
[304:14] payload or you can also access the post
[304:17] endpoints via Python code. So this
[304:20] command must include the headers to
[304:22] specify the content type and then also
[304:24] uses the hyphen d flag to includes that
[304:27] to include the data. Testing APIs using
[304:30] Postman. So Postman is a very widely
[304:33] used tool for API development and
[304:34] testing. It provides an intuitive
[304:36] interface where you can configure
[304:38] requests with different methods, headers
[304:40] and bodies. To test our API, we can
[304:43] create a new request in Postman. Specify
[304:46] the endpoint URL and then select the
[304:48] appropriate HTTP method. You can
[304:50] download the Postman for free from this
[304:52] URL. To test our API in Postman, we can
[304:56] create a new request in Postman. Specify
[305:00] the endpoint URL here and select the
[305:03] appropriate HTTP method from this pulld
[305:05] down get post and so on. For post
[305:08] request, we need to include a JSON
[305:11] payload in the body of the request. And
[305:14] then we finally click send. Then Postman
[305:17] will display the response from the
[305:18] server allowing us to verify that our
[305:21] API is working as expected. Uh Postman
[305:24] makes it very easy to test different
[305:25] scenarios and debug our APIs. Fast API
[305:28] is another modern web framework for
[305:30] building APIs with Python. It is
[305:32] designed to be fast and very easy to
