[206:43] have even sorted my indices. You can see
[206:46] in the alphabetical order this time. A
[206:48] to S. You can also reset the index. So
[206:51] let's say you want to get your names
[206:53] column back. Okay. So you have got your
[206:55] names column back. Okay. in place equal
[206:57] to true means that resetting of the
[206:58] index is done permanently. So your data
[207:01] frame has changed once again
[207:02] permanently. This has gone back to the
[207:04] original. Now this time I'm creating
[207:06] couple of nan values or missing values
[207:09] in my data frame. So some of the values
[207:11] see the fourth row essentially the fifth
[207:14] row index four. So this is the row where
[207:17] it will make a change and minus one
[207:19] means the last row. Now the columns 0 1
[207:22] 2. So essentially and this is the place
[207:25] where it will be replaced with null
[207:27] value also referred as nan. Nan is not a
[207:30] number essentially a null value. So
[207:32] these two are going to replace these two
[207:35] positions. Okay let's have a look.
[207:37] Perfect. So this is one nan here another
[207:40] nan here. Okay another thing that you
[207:42] might have noticed is the original data
[207:44] frame had the age values as a integer.
[207:47] The data type here was a integer. The
[207:50] moment we have these missing values as
[207:52] nan, the data type has changed. You can
[207:55] see that decimal point coming up. So
[207:57] this is no longer integer. It is
[207:59] actually in the float data type now.
[208:02] Okay, this is in a float data type. So
[208:04] you can verify that by using the info.
[208:09] So your age is no longer a integer. It
[208:12] is float 64-bit precision. Okay. So you
[208:16] want to know how many missing values are
[208:17] there. So these are the positions where
[208:20] the missing values are present that is
[208:22] marked with true. So true shows that
[208:26] these positions are missing values. So
[208:29] counting how many missing values by each
[208:32] column. So name column does not have any
[208:35] missing value. Gender also does not have
[208:37] any missing value. Age column has got
[208:39] two missing values and the other two
[208:41] columns don't have any missing value.
[208:43] Right? So column- wise how many missing
[208:45] values are present? you can use this
