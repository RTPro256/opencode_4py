[128:36] using indexing and slicing you can
[128:38] access the elements within the numpy
[128:41] array. And if you want you can actually
[128:43] even modify some of these elements.
[128:45] Okay. So let me create a simple numpy
[128:47] array 10 20 30 40 50. It's a simple
[128:50] one-dimensional array and the array
[128:52] elements are accessed by using square
[128:55] brackets. So this is my indexing
[128:57] bracket. If you see this is my indexing
[128:59] bracket and the element that I want to
[129:01] access is having an index of two. Now
[129:05] here I have written that Python is zero
[129:07] indexed which means the first element in
[129:09] that array will have index zero. This
[129:12] will have index one. This will have
[129:14] index two and this will have index three
[129:17] and this will have index four. So the
[129:19] last index will always be the length of
[129:21] the total array minus one. Okay. So in
[129:25] this case I'm going to get 30 because
[129:27] that is the second index basically. So 0
[129:31] 1 and two. This is 0 1 and two. Okay. If
[129:35] you want you can also specify the
[129:38] starting and the stopping index and
[129:41] optionally even the step size while
[129:43] indexing as well. So in this case I have
[129:45] given my start index as one the stop
[129:48] index as four and again the stop index
[129:53] will never be included in the slice. It
[129:56] will always stop one before the stop
[129:58] index again. So here I'm going to get
[130:00] the numbers which has the index one
[130:03] index two index three that's it. Okay.
[130:06] So three numbers I'll get in the output.
[130:08] Yeah. So that is 20 30 and 40. So 20 is
[130:11] my index one. 30 is the index two and 40
[130:14] is the index three. So in this case
[130:17] colon so this colon means take the
[130:19] entire array and give me every second
[130:22] element of that. So since you have not
[130:24] provided the starting index it will
[130:26] start from zero. Since you have not
[130:28] provided the stopping index which is
[130:30] supposed to be placed in between these
[130:32] two colons. So since you have not
[130:33] provided that number it will go till the
[130:35] end of the array. So from starting till
[130:38] the end essentially selecting the entire
[130:40] array. But now you want to pick up the
