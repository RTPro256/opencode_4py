[02:11] hugging face.
[02:13] We'll cover how to access prompt and
[02:16] interact with LLMs, giving you a peak
[02:20] into building intelligent systems.
[02:23] Overall, by the end of this course, you
[02:25] will not only understand Python
[02:27] programming, but also have hands-on
[02:29] experience working with data, connecting
[02:32] with APIs, and interacting with
[02:34] cuttingedge language models. I'm here to
[02:37] guide you at every step of the way, and
[02:40] I can't wait to see what you will
[02:42] create. Also, in case you want to dive
[02:45] deep into generative AI, machine
[02:47] learning, and deep learning, feel free

[02:54] Before we dive into the details of
[02:56] Python and its relevance in data
[02:58] science, I would like to give you a
[03:00] quick overview of what Python is and why
[03:03] it has become so crucial for today's
[03:05] data professionals. Python as you may
[03:08] know was created by Gaidoan Rasum in
[03:11] 1991. Since then it has been developed
[03:14] and maintained by Python software
[03:16] foundation growing into one of the most
[03:19] widely used programming languages
[03:21] globally.
[03:23] Now let's talk about the background of
[03:25] Python. Python is known as a highlevel
[03:28] generalpurpose programming language.
[03:30] Python has become incredibly popular
[03:33] because of its readability and
[03:35] flexibility. It is used in various
[03:38] fields such as scientific computing, web
[03:41] development and artificial intelligence
[03:43] amongst many others. One of its biggest
[03:46] advantages is that it is an interpreted
[03:49] language means it runs in a virtual
[03:52] environment which makes it platform
[03:54] independent.
[03:56] This means that it can run on almost any
[03:59] system like Windows, Mac OS or Linux
[04:03] without much hassles. Now, why should we
[04:07] use Python for data science? The short
[04:09] answer is that it ticks all the boxes.
[04:12] First, Python boasts a large and active
[04:15] community. This is really helpful
[04:17] because you have access to countless
