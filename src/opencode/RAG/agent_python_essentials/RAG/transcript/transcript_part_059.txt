[126:23] argument for any numpy array to find the
[126:26] dimensionality of that numpy array.
[126:28] Okay. So now I want to create an array
[126:30] with another function arrange. What this
[126:33] function does is it takes a starting
[126:36] number which is in this case five and
[126:38] then there is a ending number which is
[126:40] 15 and the step size of two. So it will
[126:44] start giving you numbers or it will
[126:46] create an array starting from the number
[126:48] five and it will stop one before the
[126:51] ending number. So 15 will not be
[126:53] included in that array. Okay. So 5 6 7 8
[126:57] 9 10 11 12 13 14 would be the last
[127:00] number technically. But then you have
[127:03] said give me a step size of two. So
[127:06] which means it will skip every alternate
[127:09] number. Let's see what we get after I
[127:12] just delete that two. So that is exactly
[127:14] expected from 5 to 14. But if I get that
[127:18] two back, it will skip every second
[127:20] number. So I'll get five and then I'll
[127:22] get seven. I'll get 9. The alternate
[127:26] numbers are skipped. Okay? So I'll get 5
[127:28] 7 9 11 and 13. that will be the last
[127:33] number. Perfect. Okay. So, step size you
[127:37] can set to be 2 3 4 whatever that number
[127:40] that many numbers would be skipped.
[127:42] Okay. Lind space on the other hand will
[127:45] always make sure that the starting
[127:46] number and the ending number are always
[127:49] included in the numpy array. So this
[127:52] time I'm going to create a numpy array
[127:54] which has both zero and one. And how
[127:58] many numbers do I want in that array
[128:00] specified by this five. Okay, instead of
[128:02] specifying the spacing between the
[128:04] number, you specify how many numbers do
[128:07] you want in that array which includes 0
[128:09] and one. Okay, so Python will back
[128:13] calculate the spacing and you are
[128:15] talking about the linear spacing between
[128:17] these numbers. Okay, so let's see. So
[128:19] you can see that 0 and one both are
[128:21] included and Python back calculated
[128:23] three more numbers such that the spacing
[128:26] between all the five numbers is equal.
[128:28] that is the linearly spaced numbers in
[128:31] that array. Let's see the concept of
[128:33] indexing and slicing now. So with or by
