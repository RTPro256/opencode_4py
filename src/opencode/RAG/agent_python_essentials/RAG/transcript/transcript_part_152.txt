[329:54] size, font face, what should be in a
[329:58] normal weight, bold, italic. So all the
[330:00] look and feel of the web pages of the
[330:03] forms and the results are coded within a
[330:05] CSS file. And this is the raw code of
[330:08] the HTML files that you can see.
[330:15] Hello and welcome back. In this module,
[330:18] we'll do some hands-on using chat GPT,
[330:21] Google Germany and hugging face APIs.
[330:23] So, let's get started. So, in the first
[330:26] video, we'll use JPT and Google Germany
[330:29] with Python for doing some real world
[330:32] tasks using their APIs. So, first we
[330:35] need to install OpenAI. You can
[330:38] unccommen this line of code and execute.
[330:40] Similarly, we will need to install the
[330:43] Google's generative AI package. Let's
[330:46] see how to create
[330:49] OpenAI keys which will be needed to
[330:52] access the chat GPT models. So, we will
[330:56] navigate to OpenAI
[331:00] login page.
[331:02] If you have never created an account,
[331:04] please create an account.
[331:08] If you already have an account, we'll go
[331:11] ahead and do the login.
[331:14] You might need to enter the verification
[331:16] code sent to your in inbox.
[331:20] Upon authentication, it will take you to
[331:22] the open AI platform page.
[331:25] You can see the different projects that
[331:27] you have created. So if you have never
[331:30] created a project, let it be the default
[331:32] project right now. So if you see on this
[331:35] top right side you have the API
[331:37] reference. So this will give you a quick
[331:41] idea about how the OpenAI API works.
[331:45] First about the authentication how we
[331:48] can make the requests what kind of
[331:50] endpoints are present for audio chat
[331:53] embeddings finetunings batch uh requests
[331:57] file upload and so on. So all these are
[332:01] present in this API reference page. So
[332:03] please feel free to explore this
[332:06] documentation. Then we can navigate to
[332:09] the dashboard. So from the dashboard on
[332:12] the left side you can see your API keys.
[332:15] So if you have never created an API key
[332:17] this field will appear empty. So I'll go
[332:22] ahead and create a new secret key by
