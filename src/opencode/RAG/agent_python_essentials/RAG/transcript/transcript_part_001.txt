# Python Essentials for AI Agents - Part 1
# Video ID: UsfpzxZNsPo

[00:00] Welcome to this Python essentials for
[00:02] building agents. This course will help
[00:04] you master the technical stack behind
[00:07] autonomous intelligence. This course is
[00:09] designed to take you from the core
[00:10] syntax of Python through the
[00:12] complexities of data handling and API
[00:15] integration culminating in the
[00:17] deployment of sophisticated large
[00:19] language models. You'll learn to write
[00:21] code and to architect systems that can
[00:24] reason, use tools, and solve real world
[00:27] problems using both proprietary and
[00:29] open-source AI. Hi, I'm Prashant Sahu,
[00:33] and I'm excited to have you here as we
[00:36] take our first steps into the world of
[00:38] coding, data, and artificial
[00:40] intelligence.
[00:42] In this course, we'll take a hands-on
[00:44] approach to learning. We'll start with
[00:46] the fundamentals in the module one where
[00:49] we will dive into Python basics,
[00:52] variables, data types, functions and
[00:54] more. By the end of this module, you'll
[00:57] be writing clean, efficient Python code
[01:01] and we'll have a solid foundation for
[01:03] tackling complex tasks. Next in the
[01:06] module two, we'll work with files and
[01:08] databases. We'll explore pandas, one of
[01:11] the Python's most popular libraries for
[01:14] data analysis, and get hands-on with
[01:17] databases and SQL. You'll learn how to
[01:20] connect Python to databases and manage
[01:23] data effectively, a crucial skill for
[01:26] any aspiring AI practitioner. In a
[01:29] module three, we'll explore APIs, what
[01:32] they are, why are they essential, and
[01:35] how to use them in Python. You learn to
[01:39] connect with external services, work
[01:41] with JSON data, and handle common
[01:44] challenges like authentication and rate
[01:47] limits.
[01:48] We will introduce you to how APIs power
[01:52] AI agents and large language models,
[01:55] which is where things get really
[01:57] exciting. Finally, in the module 4,
[02:00] we'll dive into working with language
[02:02] models, often called as LLMs. You will
[02:05] learn how to use libraries like OpenAI
[02:08] and explore open-source tools like
