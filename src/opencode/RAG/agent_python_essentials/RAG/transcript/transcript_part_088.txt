[188:09] essentially one-dimensional because it
[188:11] is either a single row or a single
[188:13] column. Whereas data frame is
[188:15] two-dimensional because it will have m
[188:18] number of rows and n number of columns.
[188:23] So let's see how many rows and columns
[188:24] this data frame has. So let's see
[188:29] df do.shape. So this data frame has got
[188:33] 15,929
[188:35] rows and 21 columns. You can see all the
[188:37] 21 columns by scrolling.
[188:40] Okay. So for our simple analysis in this
[188:44] notebook, okay, we'll work with a simple
[188:46] data frame that I'm going to create.
[188:49] Okay. I'm also going to import numpy and
[188:52] random module to create some random
[188:54] numbers here. Okay. So I'm importing
[188:56] pandas as pd that is the alias that I'm
[188:59] assigning it to the pandas module
[189:01] functions. And numpy is being imported
[189:03] as np that is the alias for numpy. and
[189:06] I'm importing the random module. Okay,
[189:08] so I'm fixing the seed for this random.
[189:11] Okay, this ensures consistency so that
[189:15] every time you run the code you get the
[189:17] same data frame. Okay, so I have few
[189:19] names here and uh their corresponding
[189:22] genders and I'm going to create some age
[189:25] values uh eight random numbers between
[189:28] 21 to 25. You can change this range. I'm
[189:30] also going to create some marks in these
[189:33] three subjects. Okay. So total eight
[189:35] values of subjects, eight values of
[189:38] marks in the range of 60 to 95. Highest
[189:41] would be 95, lowest would be 60. And
[189:44] then those list comprehension. This is a
[189:47] list comprehension. If you see this is
[189:48] also a list comprehension. And this is
[189:50] also so these lists are going to be
[189:53] provided to this dictionary. So this is
[189:57] a dictionary that I'm creating. This is
[189:59] the key and this is the value. So values
[190:02] are all lists. Okay. So, names is a list
[190:05] here coming from So, names is a list
[190:09] coming from here. Genders is again a
[190:11] list coming from here. Age is another
[190:14] list coming from here.
[190:17] Marks is another list which is again
[190:19] coming from here. And finally, subjects
[190:22] is also a list which is coming from
