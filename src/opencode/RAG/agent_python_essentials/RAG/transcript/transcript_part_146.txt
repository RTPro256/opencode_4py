[316:36] that is why I did not get the response
[316:38] here. Okay, I would have got response
[316:40] like serving flask app main. So let me
[316:43] stop it. Okay. Make sure that it is
[316:45] stopped and run this again. Okay. Yeah.
[316:48] So now it is serving. So I can go to the
[316:52] one of the URLs here. I have already
[316:54] given these URLs. You can access by
[316:56] directly clicking or you can copy paste.
[316:59] Okay. So first number is 16. The second
[317:01] number is four. So the division result
[317:03] is four and the square root of four is
[317:04] two. Okay. That is good. Now here I'm
[317:08] getting an error because I have only
[317:10] provided number one and not the number
[317:12] two in the request. So the request is
[317:15] only giving the first number and not the
[317:17] second number. Since the second number
[317:19] is missing, I'm getting this error.
[317:21] Okay, the next request the second number
[317:23] is zero. If you see which is why the
[317:25] zero division error is coming up here
[317:28] and finally uh here the first number is
[317:31] negative which is why uh this last error
[317:34] is coming. We cannot calculate the
[317:36] square root of a negative number. You
[317:38] can also access all these endpoints via
[317:40] curl. So let me show you one of them.
[317:42] Let's say you copy this from here to
[317:45] here and then go back to your command
[317:47] prompt and just paste the URL.
[317:51] Yeah. So here I get the response. So the
[317:55] entire response is in a HTML format as
[317:57] you see. Okay. Within the H1 heading.
[318:00] Perfect. So in the next example I'm
[318:03] going to demonstrate the post method and
[318:06] some of its variants. Okay. So here I am
[318:09] enabling both the get and post method.
[318:11] So post method is typically used when
[318:14] the user wants to post a data to the
[318:16] server either as a HTML uh form or some
[318:20] JSON payload. Okay. Get method is
[318:23] typically used when the user wants to
[318:26] request some data from the server or
[318:28] downloading some data from the server.
[318:31] So in this case the form is expecting
[318:34] message field. Okay. By default if no
[318:38] message is given by the uh user it will
[318:41] take no message as the input. Fine. So
[318:44] here I'm creating a form which will be
