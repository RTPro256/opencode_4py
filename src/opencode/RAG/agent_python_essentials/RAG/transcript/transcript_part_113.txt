[244:04] robust datadriven applications that are
[244:07] backbone of AI and machine learning
[244:09] projects.
[244:11] In this video, we'll explore how to
[244:13] connect Python applications to SQL
[244:16] databases like MySQL and Postgress SQL.
[244:20] We'll discuss the advantages and use
[244:22] cases especially in the context of AI
[244:25] agents and generative AI applications
[244:28] and provide code examples to illustrate
[244:30] the concepts. By the end of this
[244:31] session, you will have a foundational
[244:33] understanding of how to integrate
[244:36] databases into your Python projects,
[244:38] enabling more dynamic and datadriven AI
[244:41] solutions. Our agenda for this video
[244:43] includes understanding the reasons and
[244:45] benefits of connecting Python to SQL
[244:47] databases. We'll delve into practical
[244:50] code examples for connecting to both
[244:52] MySQL and Postgress SQL databases. We'll
[244:55] also learn how to execute SQL queries
[244:57] directly from Python and pandas and
[245:00] discuss how to manipulate data once it
[245:02] is imported into Python. Why connect
[245:04] Python to SQL databases? Connecting
[245:06] Python to SQL databases offers numerous
[245:09] advantages. Databases are designed to
[245:11] efficiently store and retrieve large
[245:14] amounts of data which is essential for
[245:16] AI applications that require access to
[245:20] extensive data sets. They provide
[245:22] scalability and high performance
[245:24] ensuring that your application can
[245:26] handle growth. Realtime data access
[245:29] allows AI agents to make decisions based
[245:32] on the most current information.
[245:34] Additionally, integrating databases with
[245:37] Python enables seamless data
[245:39] prep-processing, which is crucial for
[245:41] training accurate AI models. The use
[245:43] cases for connecting Python to SQL
[245:45] databases are vast. For instance, AI
[245:48] agents needing dynamic data can retrieve
[245:51] and process customer information on the
[245:53] fly. Chatboards are a great example.
[245:56] They need access to updated customer
[245:58] data to provide helpful responses.
[246:01] Another use case is generative AI
[246:03] applications that depend on stored data
