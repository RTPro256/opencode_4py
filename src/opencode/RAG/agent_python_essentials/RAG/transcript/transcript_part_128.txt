[277:15] and then finally commit and whatever the
[277:18] results would be displayed. So
[277:21] connection to Postgress database is
[277:22] successful. This is the query which I'm
[277:24] going to pass here and execute that
[277:28] query. So this query was executed and
[277:31] then you can close the connection. So
[277:33] again if you want to use the pandas
[277:37] read_sql function so that all the
[277:39] results of the query are directly dumped
[277:43] into a pandas data frame. Then you have
[277:46] to again go back to SQL alchemy engine.
[277:49] So again the same connection string. So
[277:52] this is the only thing which is
[277:53] different. So the name of the database
[277:55] uh name means the type of database. So
[277:58] earlier it was MySQL and then the name
[278:00] of the connector. So here we had used
[278:03] the MySQL connector in the previous
[278:05] case. Here I'm using the psychopg2
[278:08] connector and then this part remains the
[278:10] same and the rest of the code also is
[278:13] the same. You create a SQL alchemy
[278:15] engine and then query define a query and
[278:18] then execute that query with that
[278:20] connection. Okay, let's see. Perfect. So
[278:23] the same database I have been able to
[278:26] connect and retrive all the records. Now
[278:28] the advantage of psychopg2 over my SQL
[278:32] connectors is that the psychopg2
[278:34] directly also offers you a perpetual
[278:38] connection with your database just like
[278:41] your SQL alchemy engine. Okay, we use
[278:44] the SQL alchemy engine within the reads
[278:46] SQL function. The good thing about
[278:48] psychopg2 is you can actually use that
[278:52] connection that you are creating using
[278:54] psychopg2 to fire SQL queries directly
[278:58] to your database. Okay, although this is
[279:00] not recommended and that is why this
[279:03] warning comes up. So pandas only support
[279:06] SQL alchemy connectable which is what we
[279:08] did previously. Uh although it is
[279:11] working but uh this is not safe neither
[279:14] it is supported. So this just worked and
[279:17] it is also giving us a recommendation to
[279:20] use SQL alchemy instead. Okay, which is
[279:24] what we did just before. So this is not
[279:26] recommended. However, it works. Just in
[279:28] case you want to experiment. Finally,
