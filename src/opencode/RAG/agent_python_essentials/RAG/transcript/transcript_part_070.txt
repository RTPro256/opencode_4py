[150:12] want to generate the random numbers
[150:14] integers in this case. The lowest value
[150:17] being zero, highest value being five and
[150:19] I want to pick five numbers. Okay, so
[150:22] these are the numbers that I get and
[150:24] these numbers can also be repetitive.
[150:26] Okay, so randomly I'm picking five
[150:28] numbers by replacement. Okay, so I get
[150:33] this array. Okay, here I'm creating
[150:36] random numbers which are in the range of
[150:38] 0 to one. Zero is inclusive, one is
[150:41] exclusive. Okay, so it's a open interval
[150:43] on the other side. I'm going to create
[150:46] five random numbers in that range. So
[150:49] these are the five random numbers that
[150:51] you have got. If you want, you can also
[150:53] round off these random numbers. So let
[150:56] me round it to two decimal points. So
[150:58] you can see the random numbers were
[151:00] generated and also rounded off to two
[151:03] decimal points. I can also create
[151:04] normally distributed random numbers.
[151:06] Location is the mean of the random
[151:08] numbers. Scale is the standard deviation
[151:11] and size means how many random numbers
[151:13] do you want to create. Okay. So size
[151:16] determines how many numbers you want.
[151:18] And the mean of these five numbers would
[151:20] be close to zero. It cannot guarantee
[151:22] that it will be exactly zero. And the
[151:24] standard deviation of these five numbers
[151:26] will be close to one. Here you have your
[151:28] numbers. Okay. You can also do the
[151:30] shuffling. So let's say I've got an
[151:32] array of these five numbers and I want
[151:34] to shuffle them. So this is the shuffled
[151:37] array. Here you are not generating
[151:39] anything but you are generating another
[151:40] array with the numbers which are
[151:42] shuffled from the previous array. You
[151:44] can also create random permutation of
[151:47] these numbers. Okay. Okay. So in
[151:49] conclusion in this Jupyter notebook I
[151:51] have demonstrated how you create
[151:53] different arrays by using the built-in
[151:55] numpy functions. We have done enough
[151:57] examples on indexing, slicing, array
[151:59] manipulations in terms of shape, reshape
[152:02] function. We have used also flattening
[152:04] function like rival arithmetic
