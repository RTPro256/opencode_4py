[217:48] provide index. So here goes the index.
[217:51] So here goes the index and the
[217:53] aggregation functions are applied on the
[217:55] values here. So you can also apply
[217:57] multiple aggregation functions if you
[217:59] want. Yeah, you can see. So this is the
[218:02] mean marks and the minimum marks. So
[218:04] multiple aggregation functions can be
[218:06] easily applied. So what is the
[218:08] difference between pivot tables and
[218:10] group by then? So group by typically
[218:11] works for single dimensional summaries
[218:14] whereas pivot table is more flexible and
[218:16] ideal for multi-dimensional summaries.
[218:18] Let's take an example. So here I'm
[218:21] creating a single dimensional summary.
[218:23] For each gender I want to get the
[218:26] average updated marks. So the females uh
[218:30] updated marks average value is 82.33 and
[218:35] for males the average is 83.6. Now not
[218:39] only the average of the marks but let's
[218:41] say I want to get the average marks of
[218:45] each gender across the three subjects.
[218:48] So that is where the pivot table would
[218:50] be a better choice. So if you see so for
[218:53] each gender
[218:56] and each subject so these are the three
[218:58] subjects. So subject one subject two
[219:01] subject for each subject I've got my
[219:04] mean aggregation function here is the
[219:06] mean. So this is the average marks for
[219:08] each of the three subjects and these
[219:10] subjects are uh being put in the
[219:14] columns. Can you see the columns
[219:17] are in the subject and index
[219:21] is present here in the rows. Okay. So
[219:23] index always refers to the rows columns
[219:26] anyway in the columns and the values for
[219:29] which the aggregation function is going
[219:31] to be applied.
[219:33] Okay. So this aggregation function is
[219:35] going to be always applied on the
[219:37] values. So that is how you can create
[219:39] more complex summaries by using pivot
[219:42] tables. Finally, let's have a look into
[219:45] how can we use apply and map functions.
[219:48] So, I'm uh so we have already seen the
[219:52] lambda function being applied on a
[219:54] single column, right? We have already
[219:56] updated that. So, these are the marks.
