[94:41] Python best coding practices. So, the
[94:44] Python best coding practices are needed
[94:46] to have good code readability,
[94:49] maintainability, and the best efficiency
[94:51] for the codes. So we'll be following
[94:54] some guidelines especially the PEP 8 and
[94:56] PEP 257 style guidelines that will help
[94:59] us to write cleaner more Pythonic and AI
[95:04] development friendly ready code. So
[95:06] let's get started. So in this notebook
[95:08] we are going to cover these four topics.
[95:10] Uh how to write down clean codes in
[95:12] Python, effective use of comments and
[95:14] then how do you write Pythonic codes for
[95:18] AI development. we'll take some uh 9 to
[95:20] 10 examples and then we'll take some
[95:22] examples of PEP 8 and PEP 257 style
[95:25] guidelines.
[95:27] So for the first one, how to write down
[95:29] clean code in Python. I'm giving a
[95:31] simple example where I'll be
[95:33] demonstrating a bad code followed by a
[95:36] good code. Okay, let's take the first
[95:38] example here. So in this first example,
[95:42] I am demonstrating how to write down
[95:45] meaningful variable names and function
[95:47] names. Okay, so in the bad code, can you
[95:50] see that the function name is very short
[95:54] and the variable names are just a and b.
[95:56] So we should avoid single letter
[95:58] variable names and uh the function names
[96:01] also should be self-explanatory.
[96:04] Okay. So although this is a working code
[96:07] you can just check but a better version
[96:09] of this code would be write down a
[96:11] proper function name which is
[96:12] self-explanatory illustrative and
[96:15] whatever the inputs or variable names
[96:16] that you are using that also has to be
[96:19] slightly more descriptive semantic. Okay
[96:22] so you are providing two numbers as the
[96:25] input. So let the inputs be called as
[96:27] first number and the second number and
[96:29] then you can do any computation on these
[96:31] two numbers and return them. So here
[96:33] this function is more descriptive
[96:35] compared to the cal function and the
[96:37] parameter names are also more
[96:38] descriptive. In the second example we
[96:41] are demonstrating that a bad code would
