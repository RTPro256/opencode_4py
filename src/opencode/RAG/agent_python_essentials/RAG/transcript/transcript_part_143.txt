[309:48] to stop the flash server.
[309:50] Done.
[309:52] Now let's move on to the next uh route.
[309:54] So here we are going to create an app
[309:57] routt which takes a user input and does
[310:00] some computation. So we'll have two app
[310:02] roots here. One is to greet the user
[310:04] with some name and this name will be
[310:06] provided by the user. Okay. So if I'm
[310:08] providing prashant, it will greet hello
[310:11] prashant in H1 heading. So this is the
[310:14] HTML code that I am wrapping it up with.
[310:17] Okay. And secondly, there is another
[310:20] endpoint created called as /square which
[310:23] expects some integer as a number. Okay.
[310:26] So when the user provides that number uh
[310:29] I'm going to square that number and wrap
[310:32] it up within this HTML string and
[310:35] display it back on the browser window.
[310:37] Let's see. So this flask uh app is
[310:40] running. Okay. Now if I click on this,
[310:44] it says URL not found because there is
[310:46] nothing defined in the root URL or the
[310:49] root app. Okay. The root endpoint. Okay.
[310:53] The only endpoints defined in this flask
[310:55] app is greet and square. Okay. So I
[311:00] should be accessing the greet and the
[311:03] square endpoints only. So what I'm going
[311:05] to do is let me copy my greet URL. Okay.
[311:10] I'll just copy and paste it here with my
[311:13] name. So now you can see hello Prashant.
[311:16] So if I just change the name in the URL
[311:19] okay to ammy you can see the response
[311:23] comes as hello ammy okay so greet/greet
[311:27] is my endpoint and beyond that the user
[311:30] input that's exactly what this endpoint
[311:32] does it takes the user input as the name
[311:34] and displays hello name the other one is
[311:37] the square so you can access it here so
[311:41] I'll just copy this and uh replace it so
[311:44] I can provide some number here let's
[311:46] Okay 100. So this is the number which
[311:48] was provided and this is the square of
[311:50] that number. Okay. If you want you can
[311:52] also access this URL on or by using curl
[311:56] command. So all you have to do is just
[311:58] type curl and then the endpoint URL
[312:02] along with the user input. This is very
[312:04] important. If you forget the user input,
[312:06] you'll get some error. Okay. So let's
