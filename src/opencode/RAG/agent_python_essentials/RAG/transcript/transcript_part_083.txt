[177:14] here reference to the second subplot and
[177:16] then that's the title you are providing.
[177:19] Okay, sup title is the super title.
[177:22] Basically, that will be the title
[177:23] provided at the top of both the
[177:26] subplots. Okay, and tight layout will
[177:29] trim any extra spaces that is on each of
[177:33] the edges of the plots. If there are
[177:35] extra spaces that will be trimmed,
[177:37] that's the tight layout. Let's see. So,
[177:39] this is how I get. If you want it to be
[177:42] one below the other then you have to go
[177:44] with the other notation that is let's
[177:46] say I want to have two rows I will
[177:49] change this to two and I want to have
[177:52] one column so two rows and one column
[177:54] will give you one below the other okay
[177:56] so in this case I might want to go with
[178:00] 6 by 14 let's see that's too big so 6 by
[178:07] 10 that should be fine
[178:10] Yeah. So you can see so height is 14 and
[178:13] the width is six this time. Okay. So you
[178:17] can customize this and then uh you can
[178:19] also create multiple figures. Okay. So
[178:21] this is one figure and then another
[178:24] figure or if you want to place both the
[178:26] codes in one box you'll get two figures
[178:30] back to back. Okay you'll get two
[178:32] figures back to back because we have
[178:34] plt.show function two times. So both the
[178:37] figures are created back to back in the
[178:39] same canvas. So you have created the
[178:42] canvas for each of the figures. Okay. So
[178:45] this way also you can customize. You
[178:47] want to have it side by side then it's
[178:50] better to go with a subplot or if you
[178:52] want to have one above one below the
[178:54] other then you can go with this option
[178:56] as well. Okay. And then we have the
[178:58] styling. How you want to show the
[179:00] background of the subplots that's the
[179:01] style. So by default our language uses
[179:04] the ggplot option. So you do have other
[179:06] stylesheets like seabbond, bm and so on.
[179:10] So let's use the default ggplot which is
[179:14] available in our language. So ggplot
[179:16] stylesheet. So again I'm creating my
[179:18] figure the plots the x-axis values
[179:21] y-axis values. I'm creating a scatter
[179:23] plot and this is the new thing that we
