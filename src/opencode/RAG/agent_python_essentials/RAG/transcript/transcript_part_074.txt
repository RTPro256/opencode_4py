[158:23] there somewhere. Okay. And then you have
[158:24] multiple shades of pink and red. Okay.
[158:29] Crimson, deep pink, hot pink, magenta
[158:32] and so on. Purple, dark magenta. You can
[158:35] provide any of these names. So coming
[158:37] back. So this is how you can change the
[158:39] name of the color. Now line styles. Now
[158:42] instead of dash, let me give double dash
[158:45] and that will give me a dotted line.
[158:47] Okay, you can see sorry a dashed line.
[158:50] This is a dashed line. Okay, so to get
[158:53] the dotted line you can go for colon. So
[158:56] this gives me dotted line. You can see
[158:58] very well this is a dotted line and you
[159:00] can go for a dot dash as well. So dot
[159:03] dash should also be there.
[159:10] Okay.
[159:12] So that is dash dot. Okay. So the dash
[159:16] and dot. So where do we search for these
[159:19] line styles? So again go to Google and
[159:21] search for mattplot line styles. Click
[159:24] on the first link and you can see all
[159:27] the line styles available in mattplot.
[159:29] So these are the most common ones. Again
[159:31] if you want to have more exotic line
[159:34] styles you can experiment with these
[159:35] advanced options but these are the most
[159:38] common ones. Dash is a solid line. You
[159:40] can get a dotted line, dash dash line
[159:43] and a dash dot line. Okay. So you can
[159:46] see how these lines look like. Perfect.
[159:49] So coming back again. So I have taught
[159:53] you how you can customize the font
[159:55] sizes, the colors, the line styles and
[159:57] even you can change the line width. So
[159:59] if you want you can make it three that
[160:01] will become thicker line. You can see
[160:03] the line thickness has increased. Okay.
[160:05] So you can customize this as you want.
[160:08] Fine. And then this legend function will
[160:10] actually
[160:12] place this legend in the plot. So if you
[160:14] forget to provide the legend here you
[160:17] can see what this plot represents that
[160:20] is what is given by the legend. Okay. So
[160:22] that legend is gone because I commented
[160:24] that and you can also provide the
[160:27] location where you want to place the
[160:29] legend. So the value in the legend is
[160:31] populated automatically by the label. So
