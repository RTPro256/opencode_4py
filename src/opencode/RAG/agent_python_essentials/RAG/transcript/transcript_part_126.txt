[272:57] specific column. So in this case let me
[272:59] retrive all the students
[273:01] uh and order them by their marks in
[273:04] machine learning subject. Select star
[273:06] from students and then order by machine
[273:09] learning marks in the descending order.
[273:11] DC is for descending order. Let's see.
[273:14] So machine learning marks and in the
[273:16] descending order. Okay. So another SQL
[273:20] query which will calculate the average
[273:21] marks for all the students. Okay. In the
[273:23] statistics course. So first it fetches
[273:26] all the marks from statistics subject
[273:29] and then using the average function it
[273:32] calculates the average. So statistics is
[273:35] fetched and then average function is
[273:37] calculated. So 84.55 is the average
[273:40] statistics marks for all the 20
[273:42] students. Now another SQL query which
[273:44] will count the total number of students
[273:47] in the table. So this should be 20. You
[273:50] can also group by the students by their
[273:53] age and calculate the average marks. So,
[273:56] so 84.75 is the marks obtained by all
[273:59] the students who have a age 20 years.
[274:01] 81.4 is the marks obtained by all the
[274:04] students who have a age 21 years and so
[274:07] on. So you can have a subject wise
[274:09] average. You can also have a age- wise
[274:11] average that you can decide what you
[274:13] want to do. One final note um is
[274:17] although SQL alchemy engine is quite
[274:21] efficient because the correction is
[274:24] automatically closed the moment the
[274:26] query is executed. Here you have passed
[274:28] the engine and once the query is
[274:31] executed the engine closes the
[274:33] connection from the database. But there
[274:36] could be scenarios where the connection
[274:40] may not be closed because there are
[274:42] multiple such connections open and
[274:44] multiple people are accessing the same
[274:47] resource the same database. So in that
[274:49] case it is a a good programming practice
[274:52] to close the connection once you are
[274:55] done completely. So if you're repeatedly
[274:57] using this engine and you want to ensure
[275:00] that all the connections are closed at
[275:01] the end then you can use the engine.pose
[275:04] dispose function. So this is typically
