[44:39] else. If this is not true, the control
[44:44] goes to else. Once again, I repeat, if
[44:46] this is true, this will be executed. If
[44:49] this condition is false, the control
[44:51] automatically goes to the else block. So
[44:54] the else block has this print and so the
[44:56] next print will be executed. You can
[44:58] also check multiple conditions. So here
[45:00] a is 8, b is 10. I'm checking whether a
[45:03] is greater than 10 as well as b is
[45:06] greater than 10. So it's a you can say
[45:08] compound condition. So two conditions
[45:11] are being checked. So this if will be
[45:14] true only and only if both these
[45:17] statements are true because of the and
[45:19] operator. Okay. So true and true will
[45:23] give me if condition as true. L if here
[45:27] I'm checking whether a is greater than
[45:29] five and b is also greater than five. So
[45:31] if this is true and this is also true
[45:35] then this will be printed. Okay. Else if
[45:38] none of these are executed then the
[45:41] control automatically goes to else.
[45:43] Let's see. Perfect. So here this
[45:46] condition got satisfied. It seems that
[45:48] this condition got satisfied. Now I'm
[45:51] taking the user input by using the input
[45:53] function. Okay. So the user input goes
[45:56] to X as a string. I have to convert it
[45:58] into a integer. Okay. So by default the
[46:01] output of the input function will be a
[46:03] string. I have to type cast it into a
[46:05] integer. So now x is replaced.
[46:09] Originally your x was a string. Now that
[46:11] is replaced as a integer in the second
[46:14] line. Now I'm dividing that by two and
[46:17] checking the remainder. Is the remainder
[46:20] equal to zero? Okay. This is a modulo
[46:22] operator. So modulo operator will return
[46:24] you the remainder after division. Okay.
[46:27] So the remainder after division is
[46:30] checked whether it is zero. If the
[46:32] remainder after division with two is
[46:35] zero that means the number is even. So
[46:38] I'm checking here whether the number
[46:40] given by the user input is even or odd.
[46:44] Simple. So let me give some number here.
[46:46] Let's say 15. So 15 divided by two. You
[46:49] can just manually check 15 modulo 2 will
[46:54] not give you zero. So one is not same as
