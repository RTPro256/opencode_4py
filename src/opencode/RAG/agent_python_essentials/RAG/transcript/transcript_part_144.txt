[312:07] see what happens if I forget the user
[312:09] input. Okay. It says 404 not found. And
[312:12] this error is primarily because the user
[312:16] input was not provided. So I'm trying to
[312:18] access the endpoint without providing
[312:20] the user input. And this error message
[312:22] is also logged in here. Okay. 404. Okay.
[312:25] So 200 means the status okay means the
[312:29] request was successful and the response
[312:32] was generated successfully and served
[312:34] back to the user. So 200 is good. 404 is
[312:38] not good. Okay. Now there might happen
[312:40] that you want to actually provide a
[312:44] name. So for example, let me go back. Uh
[312:47] my full name is Prashant Sahu. So if I
[312:50] try to give a space, okay, if you see
[312:53] here in the address bar, it
[312:55] automatically appends an um percentage
[312:59] sign. This is the URL encoding for the
[313:03] whites space which I provided. Okay. So
[313:05] percentage 20 that is the complete URL
[313:08] encoding. So if you want to use some
[313:11] special characters in the user input
[313:14] make sure that the URL is properly
[313:16] encoded. So you can actually check the
[313:19] uh W3 schools um URL for a complete
[313:23] reference on URL encoding. Also there is
[313:26] a link which will help you to generate
[313:28] the URL encodings freely online. So once
[313:32] I type my name let's say Prashant space
[313:35] Sahu you can see that automatically that
[313:38] space was encoded with percentage 20. So
[313:41] that should be the complete user input.
[313:43] So let's say tomorrow I want to go for
[313:45] another name um John Doe. So this is
[313:49] what I get automatically. So this is to
[313:52] be copied and now I can paste it where I
[313:57] want to access the URL. So greet and uh
[314:01] delete this. Paste it. Press enter.
[314:04] Super. So this makes the API calls very
[314:08] safe. Also you can uh use error handling
[314:10] which I have done in other routes. So in
[314:14] the third example I'm actually going to
[314:16] do some error handling as just
[314:19] mentioned. Okay. So in this I'm going to
[314:21] actually use the gu get method
[314:23] explicitly. In fact, if you noticed
[314:25] behind the scenes in the first two you
[314:27] in the first two endpoints also we were
[314:30] able to access the endpoints using the
