[146:00] variance is 6.67 67. Similarly, I want
[146:04] to get the minimum value, the maximum
[146:06] value, the index of the minimum value
[146:09] and then the index of the maximum value.
[146:12] That is the meaning of ar in that is the
[146:14] argument. Short form of that argument is
[146:16] arge min and ar max. So that will give
[146:19] you the index of the minimum and the
[146:20] maximum values respectively. So zero
[146:23] that is the very first element here and
[146:26] 8 is the last element. Anyway again we
[146:29] can get the median. So median of all the
[146:32] nine numbers is five and the first
[146:34] quartile is at three. Okay, you can
[146:37] change the quartiles here. 025.5 will
[146:40] give you the median 75 will give me the
[146:43] third quartile and one will give me the
[146:45] maximum value. Zero will give me the
[146:47] minimum value. So these are the five
[146:49] point summary of any you know data. You
[146:53] can also do the summation along a
[146:54] particular axis. Okay. So what does this
[146:56] mean? If you want to do the summation
[146:58] along the rows, you you can specify the
[147:00] axis as one. And if you want to do do
[147:02] the summation along the columns, then
[147:06] you can specify the axis as zero. So how
[147:09] do you want to do the sum? If you want
[147:10] to do the sum all together of all the
[147:13] numbers, then you do not have to specify
[147:15] the access parameter. It will take the
[147:17] sum of all the elements anyway by
[147:20] default. But if you want to do the
[147:21] summing along the rows or the columns,
[147:24] then you have to provide the access
[147:25] parameter. Now let's quickly have a look
[147:27] into the broadcasting concept that
[147:29] enables to take or to conduct
[147:32] mathematical operations between arrays
[147:35] of different shapes following certain
[147:37] rules. Let's see. So I've got a simple
[147:39] numpy array as 1 2 3 and I'm going to
[147:42] add a scalar to that numpy array. Okay.
[147:45] So what happens is this scalar is
[147:48] indirectly type casted. it is converted
[147:50] into another array in the memory behind
[147:53] the scenes and that gets replicated
[147:55] three times. So you get an array like 10
[147:57] 10 10 and that array of 10 10 10 gets
[148:01] added to each element here. So the
