[66:47] execute this and continue to the next
[66:50] iteration. Okay, the moment the number
[66:52] is five. Let's see. So number is 0 1 2 3
[66:56] 4 and if you see here the number is five
[66:58] is not printed because what happened?
[67:01] The moment the number is equal to 5, we
[67:03] continued the iteration instantly. So
[67:06] this print statement was not triggered.
[67:08] Okay, here is another example. Okay. Uh
[67:11] the user will be asked to enter a
[67:13] password which is set to be the OTP
[67:16] value which is 1 2 32. And if the OTP is
[67:19] correct then the user will be asked to
[67:21] enter the name and the city. Okay. And
[67:24] again as usual the user will get four
[67:27] trials from 1 to four. Fine. So if there
[67:30] are four trials the moment the trial
[67:33] value is equal to four that is when the
[67:35] user is left with the last trial this
[67:38] will be displayed and every time the
[67:40] user will be asked the OTP. Okay. So let
[67:43] me enter some OTP. So it says try again
[67:46] because the entered OTP is not equal to
[67:48] the OTP which is set to be 1 2 32. So it
[67:52] says the user that try again and
[67:54] continue to the next iteration. So from
[67:56] here itself the control goes to the main
[67:59] for loop. Okay. From here itself the
[68:02] control goes to the main for loop.
[68:04] That's it. So no else condition is
[68:05] checked. Okay. Else condition is not
[68:08] checked. So let's say 1 2 3. And now you
[68:12] see my entered OTP becomes equal to the
[68:17] OTP. So in that case the control
[68:19] automatically went to the else because
[68:22] here the if will return false. And since
[68:24] it returned false, the control went to
[68:27] the else where it is now asking me to
[68:29] enter my name. So I'm just entering my
[68:32] name and city. Done. Perfect. So the
[68:35] main difference between the continue
[68:38] statement compared to the break
[68:39] statement is that our code will continue
[68:41] despite the disruption when the variable
[68:44] is evaluated and equivalent to five.
[68:47] Right? Okay. Finally, we come to the
[68:49] pass statement. Pass is essentially a
[68:51] null operation. It's a valid Python
[68:53] statement which does not execute
[68:55] anything. Okay, that's what it says. So
