[288:19] lightweight and easy for both humans and
[288:22] machines to read and write. JSON
[288:24] structures data using key value pairs
[288:27] much like Python dictionaries. In the
[288:30] example shown, we have keys like name
[288:32] and age associated with the respective
[288:35] values. When working with APIs, you'll
[288:37] frequently send and receive data in JSON
[288:39] format. So, understanding it is crucial.
[288:42] Python makes interacting with API
[288:43] straightforward. There are several
[288:45] libraries for API access, but two of the
[288:48] most commonly used libraries are
[288:50] requests. This library simplifies making
[288:53] HTTP requests and handles most of the
[288:56] complexity for you. URL lib a standard
[288:59] library for URL handling though it can
[289:02] be a bit more cumbersome compared to
[289:04] requests we typically use requests
[289:07] library because it is userfriendly
[289:10] concise and supports all HTTP methods
[289:13] it's perfect for making API calls
[289:16] managing sessions and even handling
[289:18] cookies all in just a few lines of code
[289:20] introduction to this requests library to
[289:23] get started with the request library you
[289:25] need to install it using pip install
[289:27] requests, then you can import it into
[289:29] your Python script. The library supports
[289:32] all the HTTP methods you will need and
[289:35] simplifies tasks like handling query
[289:38] parameters and payloads. It also
[289:40] provides response objects that include
[289:43] status codes and the content returned by
[289:45] the API. The official documentation is a
[289:48] great source for learning more about its
[289:50] features. Making requests. A get request
[289:53] is used to retrieve data from an API.
[289:56] Let's look at an example of fetching
[289:58] public data from an API. You can make a
[290:01] get request using requests.get
[290:05] function passing the URL as a parameter.
[290:08] If you need to include query parameters,
[290:11] you can pass them as a dictionary using
[290:13] the params argument. The response object
[290:16] contains the status code text content
[290:20] and can be passed as JSON if the
[290:22] response is in JSON format. The response
[290:25] object returned by the requests library
[290:27] provides several useful attributes. You
