[148:04] addition operation is still occurring
[148:06] element wise. So that creation of this
[148:09] additional array behind the scenes of 10
[148:11] 10 10 that is exactly what the
[148:14] broadcasting actually does. If you see
[148:16] this will create an array of three rows
[148:18] and one column. So it's essentially a
[148:21] column vector. All the numbers in one
[148:22] dimension. Okay. And this is a
[148:25] one-dimensional array. So this is a 2D
[148:27] array and this is a 1D array. Okay. And
[148:30] you want to add a 1D array with a 2D
[148:32] array. And so again you'll have to use
[148:35] the concept of broadcasting. So this is
[148:38] how it works. Let's take a couple of
[148:40] linear algebra functions which are very
[148:42] important ones. I create two two
[148:45] dimensional matrices 1 2 3 4 and 2012. A
[148:48] and B. I'm going to multiply A and B. So
[148:50] note that A multiplied by B is not same
[148:53] as B multiplied by A because matrix
[148:55] multiplication which is done by using
[148:58] the add the rate operator that is not
[149:01] element wise operation. Okay, let me
[149:03] show this. So these are the values of AB
[149:07] and the matrix wise multiplication
[149:08] between A and B. So this is A multiplied
[149:11] by B. This is the matrix multiplication.
[149:14] Let's see B multiplied by A. What does
[149:16] it give? Okay. So B * A is this. A
[149:20] multiplied by B is this. So that's what
[149:22] exactly I said. A into B is not same as
[149:25] B into A because these are not element
[149:27] wise multiplication. Okay. You can also
[149:29] do that same operation by using this
[149:31] function A dot doB. So the result will
[149:35] be same as what we got before. Okay. So
[149:38] you can use the dot function. You can
[149:40] also use the Matt mull function. So, np
[149:43] dot matt null that is matrix
[149:47] multiplication a comma b again make sure
[149:50] the order in which you are passing the
[149:53] arguments. So this is again a into b. If
[149:56] you say b comma a then this will be b
[149:58] multiplied by a. You can use the linear
[150:00] algebra module to get the inverse and
[150:02] the determinants. Okay. So this is the
[150:05] inverse of a and the determinant of a.
[150:08] I'll use a random module to generate
[150:10] some numbers and sequences here. So I
