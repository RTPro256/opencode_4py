[307:40] this is the flask app I'm creating and
[307:42] uh this is how we initialize the flask
[307:44] app. app equal to flask un_ame
[307:49] fine. This is the place where we are
[307:50] creating the endpoint. So this is my
[307:53] root endpoint. Uh against each endpoint
[307:56] we have to define a function. So
[307:57] basically it tells the user when the
[307:59] user accesses this endpoint what should
[308:02] be performed, what activity should be
[308:04] performed that is defined within this
[308:06] function. Okay. So this is the decorator
[308:09] which is decorating this function
[308:11] essentially. Okay. So whenever I'm going
[308:13] to access this endpoint, this is the
[308:15] function which will get triggered and
[308:17] this function is doing nothing but
[308:20] simply returning uh hello world back to
[308:23] the user. Okay. So from this code uh I'm
[308:26] just going to run the flask app. So
[308:29] ideally this entire code should be run
[308:31] using a py file. This is not a good
[308:34] practice to run flask applications or
[308:36] endpoints from uh Jupiter notebook.
[308:40] Okay. But for the sake of simplicity and
[308:43] learning, we are doing it here. But
[308:45] ideally, this should be wrapped into a
[308:47] python.py file or app.py file. And that
[308:50] app.py file should be run using your
[308:53] terminal. Okay. So, let me run this. It
[308:56] says that I'm serving this flask app uh
[308:59] with a debug mode off. And this is the
[309:02] URL where it is running. So, let me
[309:03] click on this URL. And there you go. You
[309:07] can see that the flask app has returned
[309:10] me hello world. Okay. So this is being
[309:12] served whenever I'm accessing that
[309:14] endpoint. This was very easy. You can
[309:17] also access this URL by using curl
[309:20] command. So I'll just copy this. So curl
[309:22] commands can be accessed from your
[309:24] command prompt. So I'm running my
[309:26] command prompt cmd. Here I can directly
[309:29] paste my curl command and enter. You can
[309:31] see the output here as hello world.
[309:34] Right? Okay. So I'll have to stop this.
[309:37] And how do I stop this? There is a
[309:39] interrupt terminal or interrupt kernel
[309:42] button over there. So I'll click on this
[309:44] interrupt the kernel to interrupt the or
