[26:49] all variables are present in your
[26:51] current name space just type whose and
[26:55] you can see that all these variables are
[26:57] existing in the current name space. Okay
[26:59] you can use all these variables for
[27:01] calculations.
[27:04] So let's do some quick data type
[27:06] conversions. Let me convert a float into
[27:08] integer. So my age is 26.3333
[27:12] something. I am converting that age into
[27:14] an integer by using the int function.
[27:17] int is used for type casting uh float to
[27:20] a integer. Okay. So you can see 26.333
[27:24] has been type casted into integer. So
[27:27] what this function does is it simply
[27:29] ignores the decimal point and anything
[27:32] beyond the decimal point. It only takes
[27:34] the integer part of that float.
[27:36] Similarly, I can convert a string into
[27:38] integer also. So if I'm trying to add a
[27:41] string to a uh integer, this will give
[27:44] me an error. So this is a string in
[27:46] single quotes and this is an integer. So
[27:49] you cannot add a string to integer. This
[27:51] operation will give me a error. You can
[27:54] see. But if I type cast this two from
[27:59] string to an integer this I'm converting
[28:02] this two from string two to a integer
[28:05] two I can still add with this integer
[28:09] six okay so let's do that perfect so
[28:12] this is how it works okay here the two
[28:14] string two was type casted into a
[28:17] integer and then this becomes integer
[28:19] this is already integer so integer
[28:21] addition happens and finally returned is
[28:24] also an integer you can check that the
[28:26] data type of my int is also an integer.
[28:30] I'll see you back in the presentation
[28:33] and we'll continue with the operators in
[28:35] Python. In Python, operators are symbols
[28:38] that perform operations on variables and
[28:40] values. These include arithmetic
[28:43] operations like addition,
[28:44] multiplication, division, and more.
[28:47] Think of operators as tools in a
[28:50] toolbox. They help you manipulate the
[28:52] data stored in your variables. For
[28:54] example, if you want to add two numbers,
[28:57] you would use the plus operator. Easy,
[28:59] right? And operand is the value on which
