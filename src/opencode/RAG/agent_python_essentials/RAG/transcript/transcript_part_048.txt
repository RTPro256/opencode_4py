[103:17] directly. So it generates two thing. It
[103:20] is also a generator function like range
[103:22] but range function only generates
[103:24] numbers. The enumerate function
[103:26] generates two things. One is the index
[103:29] which is numbers and then the values are
[103:31] fetched from the data itself. So when
[103:33] you run this, so let me just run this.
[103:37] So the outputs are same but this is much
[103:39] more Pythonic. Okay, this is much easier
[103:41] to comprehend. So the enumerate function
[103:44] actually returns you a tuple. The first
[103:45] element of the tuple would be index. The
[103:47] second element of the tuple would be the
[103:49] item. You are directly able to access
[103:51] the item as well as the index of that
[103:53] item. Now some more examples of pep 8
[103:57] and pep 257 style guidelines. So let's
[104:00] start with the pep 8 first. So Pepe
[104:02] talks about how to write down better
[104:06] Python codes in terms of nomomenclature
[104:08] of the variables of the functions of the
[104:11] classes. How many spaces you should be
[104:13] using? Where should you be using those
[104:16] spaces? How many spaces you should be
[104:19] using for indentation? Where should the
[104:21] indentation should be be provided? How
[104:23] nesting or how deep nesting indentation
[104:27] are done and so on. Okay. PEP is a
[104:30] Python enhancement program. So you can
[104:34] check the PEP 8 guidelines in detail by
[104:37] following this link
[104:41] and this has been written by none other
[104:43] than Gaidoan Rasum. He is the creator of
[104:46] Python language. Okay. So you can get
[104:48] the details about the pepaid guidelines
[104:51] from this documentation page. So here
[104:54] I'll be talking about the most important
[104:56] style guidelines. So first is about the
[104:59] variable naming conventions. So again I
[105:02] have already repeated but once again I
[105:05] repeat here. So do not provide variable
[105:07] names which are just single letter
[105:09] variables. So they are unclear and very
[105:12] difficult to make out what they signify,
[105:15] what kind of data it holds and so on.
[105:18] Okay. Write your variable names which
[105:20] are more descriptive and semantic. So
[105:24] that is what we call as the snake case.
[105:26] uh basically separating multiple words
