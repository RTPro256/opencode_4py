[239:52] more. There are mainly two types of
[239:53] databases, relational and non-
[239:56] relational. Relational databases
[239:58] organize data into tables with rows and
[240:01] columns much like spreadsheet and they
[240:04] use SQL for quering and managing data.
[240:07] Examples include MySQL, Postgrace SQL
[240:10] and SQite. They are great for storing
[240:12] data with fixed relationships. Think of
[240:15] customer records linked to orders.
[240:18] Non-reational databases, often referred
[240:20] to as NoSQL databases, store data in
[240:24] formats like documents, key value pairs,
[240:27] or even graphs, allowing them more
[240:29] flexible schema designs. Examples of
[240:32] NoSQL databases include MongoDB, radius,
[240:35] and Cassandra. These are often used when
[240:37] data doesn't fit neatly into tables or
[240:40] when scalability is crucial, such as in
[240:43] social media applications. Databases
[240:45] play a critical role in data management
[240:48] by providing a centralized place to
[240:50] store and organize data. They are
[240:52] designed to handle large volumes of data
[240:54] making them scalable solutions for
[240:56] growing needs. Databases ensure data
[240:59] integrity meaning that the data remains
[241:02] accurate and consistent over time. They
[241:04] also support concurrency allowing
[241:06] multiple users to access and modify data
[241:09] at the same time without conflicts. Most
[241:12] importantly for us, databases serve as
[241:14] the foundation for AI because data is
[241:17] the fuel that powers AI algorithms. Now,
[241:20] let's talk about SQL, the structured
[241:22] query language. SQL is the standard
[241:24] language used to communicate with
[241:26] relational databases. It's used to
[241:29] create tables, insert and retrieve data,
[241:32] and perform updates and deletions. If
[241:34] you think of database as a library, then
[241:37] SQL is the librarian helping you find
[241:40] the book you need, update information,
[241:42] or even add new books to the shelves.
[241:44] Understanding SQL gives you the power to
[241:46] interact with databases effectively.
[241:49] Retrieving the exact information you
[241:51] need for your applications. Let's look
[241:53] at some basic SQL commands. The create
[241:55] table command is used to create a new
