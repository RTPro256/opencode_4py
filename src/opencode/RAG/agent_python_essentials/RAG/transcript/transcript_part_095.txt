[204:31] So the index instead of 0 to 8 which it
[204:34] was earlier showing now the index values
[204:36] are the actual names of the students. So
[204:39] these are my row indices. Okay. So this
[204:42] is a data frame which has proper labels
[204:45] for the rows as well as for the columns.
[204:47] So these are my column labels and these
[204:50] are my row labels. Now the indices are
[204:54] still 0 to the index of the first column
[204:57] is now 0 1 2 3. The index of the first
[205:02] row is still zero and going up to 7.
[205:04] Okay, you can just check. So the index
[205:07] is always going to start from zero.
[205:09] Whatsoever be the labels. So earlier
[205:12] when we created this data frame the row
[205:14] labels and the indices were same but now
[205:16] I have changed my row labels. The index
[205:18] cannot be changed. Index will always be
[205:20] numeric auto incremented. Okay. So we
[205:23] can also do sorting. So let me sort this
[205:26] entire data frame based on the updated
[205:28] mark. So by default it will be in the
[205:30] ascending order. What do you know? So
[205:32] you can do a shift tab tab and it shows
[205:35] ascending as true. So by default it will
[205:38] be in the ascending order. Okay. So if
[205:41] you want to be in descending order so
[205:44] then you have to make ascending equal to
[205:47] false. Okay. So now this is in
[205:49] descending order. 96 93 86 down up to
[205:54] 69. So this is pretty much in the
[205:56] descending order. You can also sort
[205:58] values based on two columns. So whenever
[206:01] the age values are equal then the
[206:03] sorting happens based on updated marks.
[206:06] So if you have a look here again this is
[206:09] by default ascending order. So here the
[206:12] age values are same. So then sorting
[206:15] happens based on the updated marks.
[206:17] Okay. So whenever the age values are
[206:19] same sorting happens based on the marks.
[206:22] So that is two levels of sorting
[206:25] happening. So the first level is age. In
[206:27] any case, age will be strictly in
[206:29] ascending order. Okay. Whenever the age
[206:31] values are same, then the next level of
[206:33] sorting happens based on the updated
[206:35] marks. You can also sort the index. So
[206:38] this is interesting. Until now the
[206:40] indices were not sorted. Okay. Now I
