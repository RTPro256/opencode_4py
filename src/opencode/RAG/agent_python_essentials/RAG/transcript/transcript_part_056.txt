[120:02] involve vectors and matrices. Think of
[120:05] large data sets or transformations or
[120:08] solving system of equations. Now with
[120:11] Numpai's lin alg or the linear algebra
[120:14] subm module you can multiply matrices
[120:17] using the np dot function or a very
[120:20] convenient operator which is add the
[120:22] rate symbol. You can also solve system
[120:25] of linear equations like ax equal to b
[120:28] using the np.l
[120:31] dotsolve function instead of just coding
[120:33] up your own solver. And if you need to
[120:36] find the inverse or a determinant of a
[120:38] matrix, you have to choose those
[120:41] functions which are readily available in
[120:43] the linear algebra module. So for more
[120:45] advanced use cases, you have the igon
[120:48] values on vectors via the np.al
[120:52] module. You can also do the singular
[120:54] value decomposition by using the
[120:56] np.al.svd
[120:58] which is very critical in methods like
[121:00] principal component analysis for
[121:02] dimensionality reduction. You can also
[121:04] find vector and matrix norms using the
[121:07] linnom function. While numpy doesn't
[121:10] have a separate stats subm module, it
[121:12] does include quite a few statistical
[121:15] functions right in its main name space.
[121:17] So for example, np.m can calculate the
[121:20] average value. You can specify an access
[121:22] to do so for each row or for each column
[121:25] in a two-dimensional array. Similarly,
[121:27] you have the np domed median function,
[121:29] np dot quantile function that helps you
[121:33] understand the data distribution
[121:35] and so on. While np std and np.tv these
[121:41] functions calculate the standard
[121:42] deviations and variance of the data that
[121:46] helps you understand the spread of your
[121:48] data. So this makes numpy a good first
[121:51] off for exploratory data analysis before
[121:54] you move on to more advanced tools. If
[121:56] you need to understand the relationship
[121:57] between the variables, for example,
[121:59] calculating the correlation
[122:01] coefficients, you have the np.t core of
[122:03] function and you can also calculate the
[122:05] co-variances between these matrices by
[122:08] using the npoe function. You have the
