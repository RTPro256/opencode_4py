# Python Essentials for AI Agents - Part 173

[377:43] operations and asynchronous messaging
[377:46] which is ideal if you are building a
[377:48] distributed system with agents that need
[377:50] to operate independently and communicate
[377:53] as needed. Autogen has advanced
[377:56] capabilities too. It supports
[377:58] containerized code execution, meaning
[378:01] agents can write and run code in
[378:03] isolated environments. This is great for
[378:06] security and flexibility. It also works
[378:08] with multiple programming languages
[378:10] currently supporting Python and .NET
[378:12] with more languages in a pipeline. And
[378:15] if you're working on a large project,
[378:17] asynchronous messaging lets agents
[378:20] communicate without waiting, which is
[378:22] ideal for scalable distributed systems.
[378:24] To wrap things, Langchain, Langraph,
[378:27] Creai, and Autogen each offer different
[378:29] features and capabilities that fit
[378:32] different types of projects. Thank you
[378:34] for joining, and I hope this session has
[378:36] given you a clear understanding of
[378:38] what's possible with these tools.
