[190:24] here. Okay. So, I have populated all the
[190:28] five lists with these five keys.
[190:31] So, let me execute this. I'm passing a
[190:34] dictionary ultimately this is a
[190:36] dictionary from here to here it's a
[190:38] dictionary you can see this curly
[190:40] bracket so this dictionary is now being
[190:41] converted into a data frame object okay
[190:45] so this is my data frame I've got the
[190:47] names gender age marks and uh subjects
[190:52] okay so if you want to see the how many
[190:55] rows and columns are present we can see
[190:57] df dot shape so I have got eight rows
[191:00] and five columns and I and have a quick
[191:03] statistical summary of my data frame.
[191:06] Okay. So the statistical summary will
[191:08] only take the numeric columns. I have
[191:10] got only age and marks as the numeric
[191:12] columns. Uh the other three columns that
[191:15] is the name, gender and subject. These
[191:17] are the three categorical columns. So
[191:19] that is why they are not included in
[191:21] this summary. Okay. So in this summary
[191:25] what do I have? I have the count. How
[191:28] many values are present in that column?
[191:30] The mean of that entire column. So the
[191:33] mean of age values is 23.375
[191:37] years. The mean marks is 78 something.
[191:41] The standard deviations I have the
[191:43] minimum age is 21. Maximum age is 25. 50
[191:48] percentile is the median value. Same
[191:50] goes here. 64 is the minimum marks.
[191:53] Maximum is 91. And the median marks is
[191:56] 77. These are the uh first quartiles.
[191:59] This is the second quartile which is the
[192:01] median value and this is the third
[192:03] quartile and this is the fourth quartile
[192:05] also the maximum value. If you want you
[192:08] can round these values as well to let's
[192:10] say two decimal points for easy
[192:13] visibility.
[192:14] Similarly if you want to have the
[192:17] statistical summary of the categorical
[192:19] columns you can use describe
[192:24] and include the object category. Okay.
[192:28] So I have eight unique values in the
[192:31] name, two unique values in gender and
[192:33] three unique subjects. So the topmost uh
[192:36] anyway for name it doesn't matter
[192:38] because all the names are anyway unique.
