[327:34] caching the CSS and the HTML uh files in
[327:38] the server and the cached version is
[327:40] actually rendered to the user. So 304
[327:43] not modified is a HTTP status code
[327:47] indicating that the requested resource.
[327:49] What are resources are we requesting?
[327:51] Three HTML files and one CSS file
[327:53] cascading stylesheet CSS file we are
[327:56] accessing. So these are not modified
[327:59] since last time it was requested. So
[328:01] that caching helps the server to load
[328:03] these files very fast and also reduces
[328:08] the server overload and the data
[328:10] transfer is also reduced. One important
[328:13] thing that you must note is the folder
[328:15] organization of these HTML files that
[328:20] you need to have in your local so that
[328:24] the HTML files are correctly rendered
[328:27] when you run the flask app. So this is
[328:29] the Jupyter notebook which runs the
[328:32] flask app. This could be a regular
[328:34] Python file which you are using to run
[328:37] your flask app. This is the one which
[328:40] will render your flask server. Within
[328:42] this folder itself, I have got two more
[328:45] folders. One is called as templates. So
[328:48] the templates folder has the HTML
[328:50] templates. Uh the form and the results
[328:53] of the form which will be displayed and
[328:55] the home. So these are all HTML files
[328:58] which we are using in our flask cap.
[329:00] There is one more folder called a
[329:01] static. This static folder contains the
[329:03] CSS files the cascading stylesheet
[329:06] files. Now this CSS file is attached or
[329:10] linked to the all the HTML files here.
[329:14] Okay. So when I open any of these HTML
[329:17] file you can see
[329:24] that this stylesheet has been you can
[329:28] see that this stylesheet has been this
[329:30] has been referenced within the static
[329:33] folder. So that is the reason why you
[329:35] need to place your CSS file within the
[329:37] static folder. The CSS file is the file
[329:40] which will style the front end of your
[329:42] web page. Okay, it contains the styling
[329:45] information. What color, what
[329:47] background, what how should the buttons
[329:50] look like? How should the text fields
[329:52] look like? What should be the size, font
