## Key Functionality and Features

### Code Intelligence
- **Primary design focus**: Code-related functions including:
  - Code generation
  - Code completion and insertion
  - Bug detection and automated code review
  - Mathematical reasoning within code

### Broad Language Support
- Supports **338 programming languages**
- Versatile for diverse development environments

### Efficient Architecture
- Built on **DeepSeekMoE framework** with sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture
- **Performance metrics**:
  - 2.4 billion active parameters (out of 16 billion total)
  - Efficient inference and performance

### Long Context Length
- Processes code snippets up to **128K tokens**
- Handles complex and large codebases effectively

### Performance
- **deepseek-coder-v2:16b** (Lite Instruct variant):
  - Strong performance in coding/math benchmarks
  - Competes with and outperforms proprietary models in some cases

### Local and Private Operation
- Runs locally via **Ollama** model
- Ensures data privacy (proprietary code/data never leaves your environment)
