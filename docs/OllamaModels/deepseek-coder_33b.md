## Best Use Cases

- **Local Development Environments**  
  - Run locally via Ollama platform  
  - Benefits:  
    - Data privacy (code stays on your machine)  
    - No API costs  
    - Low-latency, offline capability  

- **Complex Problem Solving**  
  - 33B parameter model significantly outperforms smaller variants (e.g., 6.7B model)  
  - Capable of tackling difficult coding questions  

- **Benchmarking**  
  - Top performer among open-source code models on:  
    - *HumanEval*  
    - *MultiPL-E*  
    - *MBPP*  
  - Ideal for high-performance use cases
